<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>There can be no doubt that shedding her petticoats a
woman has shed much, if not all, of her femininity, till
she is now merely a person of an opposite sex. She is a
female; for nothing will ever make her a man, but
Woman (with a capital W), Woman with her charm,
her elusiveness, her mystery, her reserves, her virginal
withdrawals, her exquisite yieldings; she is that no
longer.</p>

<p>How much of her queenship has she not given up with
her petticoats?</p>

<p>At no time was Woman more thoroughly feminine,
more absolutely mistress of her own fascinations and
of the hearts of men, than in the eighteenth century;
preferably the latter half.</p>

<p>That was a time when it may be said that no woman
could look ugly; that beauty became irresistible. Take
the period consecrated by the art of Sir Joshua Reynolds,
and of Romney; take the picture of the Parson’s
Daughter, by the latter artist; that little face, so piquante,
innocent, fresh, sly, mischievous, is nothing at all without
its cloud of powdered curls but a very ordinary
visage; almost common indeed! With its distinctive
coiffure, framing, softening, etherealising, giving depth
to the eyes and allurement to the smile; how irresistibly
delicious! How irresistibly delicious, too, is the mode
which exposes the young throat so modestly between
the soft folds of the muslin kerchief.</p>

<p>Youth then, even without much beauty, is served to
perfection by the taste of the period. What of beauty
itself? Look at the portrait of the Duchess of Devonshire,
by Sir Joshua Reynolds, the famous one with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
big hat, where she is holding the dancing baby. There
is an answer more eloquent than any words can give.</p>

<p>And, rarest thing in a fashion! it became age as
completely. Even elderliness emerged triumphant. I
vow that Mrs. Hardcastle, Mrs. Malaprop, Mrs. Primrose
are delightful figures of buxomness on any stage. Their
double chins assume a pleasant sort of dignity, overshadowed
by the curls and loops of their tremendous
coiffures. The dress with its panniers, its apron, its
general amplitude is peculiarly advantageous to the too,
too solid flesh of the matron.</p>

<p>The mode of the moment has a singular effect on the
morals of the moment. Our emotions are more moulded
and coloured by our clothes than we are aware.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that when a young lady went panniered
and patched, fichued and ruffled, powdered and
rouged, tripping on high heels, ready for the minuet, her
feelings went delicately with her, metaphorically garbed
in daintiness to match.</p>

<p>And, when a gentleman of fashion was a Beau; when
his fine leg showed to its utmost in a silk stocking; when
his pampered hand was as elegant of gesture with a pinch
of snuff between falling ruffles as it was in whipping out a
small sword, he retained his masculine virility none the
less; but like the blade of that same small sword, was
cutting, polished, deadly, vicious even, all within the
measure of courtesy and refinement.</p>

<p>The world has mightily changed since the days when
hearts beat under the folds of the fichu or against the
exquisite embroideries of the waistcoat. Sad divagations
then, as now, were taken out of the path of rectitude,
but they were taken with a rustle of protesting petticoats,
to the gallant accompaniment of buckled shoes or, more
romantic still, dashing top-boots.</p>

<p>A tale of 1788 is necessarily a tale of petticoats.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="first">“A winning wave, deserving note</div>
<div class="verse">Of a tempestuous petticoat,”</div>

<p>cries the poet of an earlier age. Femininity must needs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
rustle and whisper, and curtsy and flounce through
every chapter.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The collaborator whose name appears for the last time
on this title page, turned to the century of The Bath
Comedy and the subsequent and connected chronicles
as a kind of relaxation of the mind from what he most
hated: the ugliness of modern life. The realism which
sets itself to describe the material, the grosser aspect of
any emotion, the brutality that miscalls itself strength,
that forcing of the note of horror—which is no more
power than the beating of a tin can or the shrieking of a
syren is music—were abhorrent to him. He liked the
pretty period in spite of its artificialities; he liked the
whole glamour of the time; he liked its reticence and
its gaiety, its politeness, its wit, and its naughtiness and
its quaintness, because, as in an artistic bout of fencing,
it was all bounded by a certain measure of grace and
rule.</p>

<p>The laughter he gave to these conceptions came, as
true laughter must, from a most innocent and wholesome
heart. It is this laughter which is his last legacy
to a sad, tangled, and rather ugly world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PROLOGUE</h2>
</div>

<p>“<i>No man is hero to his valet</i>”; so runs the cynical
adage. But you can reverse the saying with reference
to the other sex. <i>Every woman is a heroine to her lady’s
maid</i>; it may not be true in all cases, but ’tis true enough
for any proverb.</p>

<p>The romance of a lady’s own woman is centred in her
mistress. She will clothe her in finery with a greater joy
than if she were draping herself; rather than see her go
shabby she would wear sackcloth; she will hang over
the banisters, on a dinner-party night, to observe the
sit of her train as she sweeps downstairs on the arm of
some notable personage; she will lean out of the window
to watch her step into her sedan, and if there are Beaux
hovering and my Lady tosses her plumes and whisks her
panniers to proper advantage it is Abigail’s heart that
beats high with pride.</p>

<p>Even Miss Lydia Pounce, own woman to my Lady
Kilcroney, a damsel remarkable from her earliest youth
for her tart and contradictious ways, who was verging on
elderliness now with the acidity and leanness peculiar to
the “born old maid,” would have laid down her life to
ensure that my Lady’s court gown should fit her trim
waist without a wrinkle, or that the pink silk stocking
that clothed her pretty leg was drawn to its proper skin-tight
limit.</p>

<p>(Both the Incomparable Kitty and her Lydia were
exceedingly particular that these same stockings should
never be worn with the gross slovenliness that permitted
a sag. Not indeed that anything but the merest glimpse
of slender, arched feet, like the “little mice” of an
earlier poet’s fancy, peeping in and out from under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>
flutter and foam of lace and silken flounce, was ever
displayed to the vulgar eye; but to know these niceties
complete in the smallest and most delicate detail was
necessary to the comfort of any self-respecting Woman.
And on this point Lydia was in thorough sympathy with
her mistress, as upon all others connected with the elegance
and <i>bon ton</i> of the most modish of Mayfair belles;
of that leader of Fashion, Feeling and Style which the
Lady Kilcroney undoubtedly was.)</p>

<p>If Woman be a heroine to her lady’s maid, in what
light does she appear to her Milliner?</p>

<p>Here we come upon debatable ground. At first sight
it would seem that the milliner, being dependent upon
her customers for her very existence, it must follow that
whatever her private opinion may be with regard to their
appearance and taste, she can have but one burning
desire: to please her patronesses. There is nevertheless
another side to the question.</p>

<p>What Woman of intelligence but does not realise that
a Mode may make or mar her? How much may hang
on the droop of a feather; the tilt of a hat-brim; the
glow of a rose in cunning juxtaposition with the soft
carmine of a blushing cheek? Blue eyes may flash into
sudden significance under a knot of azure ribbon, that
had before languished their tenderest in vain. Saucy
innocence may triumph beneath a shepherdess wreath;
or tired charms kindle into new brilliancy stimulated by
the consciousness of the perfect inspiration. In fine, all
that life holds best is at the mercy of the mantua maker
where the Lady of Fashion is concerned. Let but a
clever business woman grasp this great and awful truth;
and she who combines the brain that can devise, the
taste that never fails, the acumen that knows no hesitation,
the finger that is at once light and firm, unerring
and ethereal, becomes to her employers a treasure beyond
the mines of Golconda!</p>

<p>Such a treasure did Miss Pamela Pounce, with whom
these pages are concerned, prove herself to the noted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span>
Madame Mirabel of Bond Street. And such an influence,
far-reaching and subtle, did she exercise on the lives of
the <i>Elégantes</i> who consulted her, with the eager submission
and reverence of the believing Greek for his Oracles,
though with far other and comfortably practical results!</p>

<p>Miss Pamela Pounce, Goddess of Modes, was <i>ipso facto</i>
Goddess of the Machine of Life, deciding, with a lucky
toss of ribbons or hitherto undreamt of combination of
fallals, the fate of her fair customers, and incidentally
that of their Beaux, their lovers and their husbands;
my Lady Kilcroney and her lazy, jolly life-loving Lord;
dark-browed Susan Verney, who would fain have bent
the whole world to her sway as she did her weary Baron;
Lady Anne, her sister, still fondly, foolishly in love with
her stalwart, countrified Squire, Philip Day; their
young sister, the last of the fair Vereker Ladies and the
naughtiest, with her tangled love-stories; Mr. Stafford,
the once famous Beau, proud of the startling beauty of
his excellent, dull, childish wife, and anxious that she
should flaunt it <i>à la mode</i> with the best of them; Sir
Jasper Standish, the sporting Baronet, who, bereaved of
his exquisite, clinging Julia, found himself entangled
beyond belief with Miss Pamela Pounce’s ribbons; the
noted young actress, Miss Falcon, known as “Fair
Fatality,” whose brief life drama was more tragic than
any she had enacted for the benefit of the public; the
plain Miss Vibart, who found beauty and love and happiness
all in a Pounce bandbox; Mistress Molly Lafone,
own sister—who would believe it?—to the pearl of
ingenuous womanhood, Prue Stafford, Molly Lafone
that minx, whom the members of my Lady Kilcroney’s
coterie were so unanimously leagued to suppress and
exclude, and who, in spite of their efforts contrived to
insinuate herself disastrously into all their combinations
(was it not under a wreath twisted by Pamela’s long
clever fingers that this elegant little adventuress came to
her most deserved catastrophe?)—there was not one of
them but came under her wand!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>But at the same time the arbiter of the fate of others,
in the shape of a very human young woman, guided the
shuttle of her own destiny, and wove a remarkably
pretty design for herself.</p>

<p>Milliners, unlike Oracles and Sybils, have each their
personal human span with its joys and fears, pleasures,
pains and triumphs. Pamela’s romance ran like a cherry-coloured
thread through the warp and woof of those
other existences, so far above her, in which her profession
had involved her. To show the whole pattern,
light and dark, sparkling and deep-hued, flowered, dotted,
arabesqued, of this brocade of earthly life, the poor
<i>Modiste</i> must assume as important a place as that of her
clientele.</p>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">How my Lady Kilcroney entered into Royal<br>
Service under the Shadow of the Italian Hat<br>
trimmed by Miss Pamela Pounce</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Miss Pamela Pounce was serving her third year
as apprentice to the great art of Hat Confectionery, under
the ægis of no less a personage than the world-famous
Madame Eglantine of Paris—once “the little French
Milliner” of Bath—her aunt and benefactress, who had
placed her in these favourable circumstances, had begun
to taste the proudest triumph of her life.</p>

<p>Miss Lydia Pounce was about to become own woman
to a Court lady! My Lady Kilcroney—to whom she had
so faithfully and ruthlessly devoted herself—from the
days when, as the Widow Bellairs, she first scintillated
in the world of fashion, to her present position of Viscountess—was
chosen by Her Majesty, Queen Charlotte,
to fill the post of Lady-in-Waiting to her own Sacred
Person.</p>

<p>To enter Court circles had been the dream of Lydia’s
angular and ambitious breast. Her mistress’s gratified
vanity was a trifling emotion compared to the bursting
satisfaction which this upward step on the social ladder
afforded the maid. It is not too much to say that she
regarded herself in the light of a Prime Minister who has
successfully brought about some great political event,
and who is a far more important person than the Sovereign
whom he serves.</p>

<p>It came to pass in this wise.</p>

<p>His Most Gracious Majesty, King George III, had
been ordered to Cheltenham Spa for the waters by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
physicians; his state of health was causing anxiety,
the extent of which was as yet quite unknown to
the bulk of his loyal subjects. Queen Charlotte, the
most devoted of spouses, of course determined to
accompany him; and the Royal party duly proceeded
to the Spa.</p>

<p>It happened to be Lady Flora Dare-Stamer’s term of
attendance on Her Majesty, and that stout estimable
Lady-in-Waiting happened to be Lady Kilcroney’s very
close and dear friend. There was nothing remarkable,
perhaps, in the conjunction of these two happenings;
but it was indeed singular that Kitty Kilcroney should
happen to discover a delicacy in her son and heir which
necessitated an instant visit to the celebrated health
resort now so vastly honoured.</p>

<p>These events having succeeded each other, nothing
more natural than that my Lady Kilcroney should invite
her “poor dear Flo” to a dish of tea and a chat at her
lodgings, to rest her of the fatigue consequent upon her
eminent but exhausting office.</p>

<p>Though Lady Flora had made no secret to her intimates
of her intention to rid herself of her honours as
soon as might be, who so surprised as her dearest Kitty
to learn that she now believed her emancipation at
hand?</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, my dear,” said Lady Flo,
chewing a macaroon, “it’s not a job that suits me in the
least. ’Twould fit you vastly better.”</p>

<p>“O, Lady Flo!” cried Kitty in accents of amazement.
“What a strange thought! I vow and declare
such an idea never crossed my mind. And, in truth,
’tis rank impossible. There are a hundred reasons, a
thousand reasons, why I am the last person likely to be
selected by Her Majesty. I am too young.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word,” said her companion bluntly. “I
doubt if there’s so much between us, my dear, were it not
that I have run to fat. These macaroons are excellent.
’Tis like your genius to be so well served in lodgings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
You’ve brought the best of your staff with you, I make
no doubt.”</p>

<p>“And, O, my love! the difficulty of housing them!
There’s scarce a tradesman in the town that hath not a
servant of mine.”</p>

<p>Kitty spoke with the careless self-importance of the
wealthy woman. And Lady Florence approved.</p>

<p>“How right of you, my love, to insist on Comfort!”
Comfort was the first and last of her aspirations. “Aye,
I will have a little more cream. This whipped stuff—I
dare swear ’tis your idea to have it so lavishly flavoured
with the vanilla; vastly delicate. Your chocolate is as
incomparable as your agreeable self! But yours are not
the years of giddiness. I speak in all friendship, I beg
you to believe.”</p>

<p>Kitty murmured in an absent voice, that she had married
her first—worthy Bellairs—a mere child, practically
out of the nursery.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, my sweet Kilcroney, no woman who has
had two husbands can deny a certain amount of experience,
and upon rep,” with a rolling laugh, “I don’t
care who knows that I’m on the wrong side of thirty!
You must be pretty well advanced on the right side of
it?”</p>

<p>“If you can call twenty-eight——”</p>

<p>“Admit to twenty-eight, by all means!—nevertheless,
’tis an age of discretion. And Her Majesty——”</p>

<p>“I understand——” said Kitty, balancing her teaspoon
on the rim of her handleless cup with a musing air—she
wondered in her soul if the excellent Lady Flo could
really be taken in by this pretence; if it were possible
she did not guess that she, Kitty Kilcroney, was longing,
grilling to step into her Court shoes—as if she cared
who knew that she was over thirty her last birthday,
and warming but to riper beauty as the months slipped
by!</p>

<p>“’Tis not,” she said aloud, with a pout, “that I would
decline a post about our gracious Queen, if ’twere offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
me, God forbid! I am too loyal a subject. But I understand
the German woman, that frumpish creature, the
Keeper of the Robes—what’s her barbarous name?—hath
the royal ear, and will not suffer anything young or
comely, if she can help it, about Her Majesty—(And
there’s one for you, my Lady Flo, with your right and
your wrong side of thirty!) ’Tis a vast of pity you will
not continue to occupy a position so honourable and so
becoming to you.”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth,” said Lady Flora unmoved,
helping herself to another macaroon, “’tis the standing
that undoes your poor friend! Conceive it, my love,
full fourteen stone, and on my feet hours every day.
Hours did I say? Centuries. Look hither!” She
thrust out a large sandalled foot, which certainly had a
plethoric appearance. “’Tis swollen beyond belief. I
acknowledge my stoutness. I made but little count of it,
for I’ve been a prodigious comfortable woman along of it.
’Tis a cushioned life. It pads the mind as it were. I
assure you, I believe myself to have been, only some
three months ago, the most good-tempered woman in
England. And now! ’Pon rep, I am growing peevish!
Fie upon it—stout and peevish! Was there ever such a
combination?”</p>

<p>As if to contradict her own statement she again gave
way to her jolly laugh. Kitty, watching her through
long eyelashes, sighed.</p>

<p>“But what can induce you to think of me, my Lady
Flo? Poor little retiring me?”</p>

<p>“Pray my dear, do not play the Molly Lafone with
me!”</p>

<p>Molly Lafone! Such a comparison was too comic!
Kitty laughed, and dropped her not very successful
mask.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, then, I believe it would suit me!
But how can it be accomplished? I am not one to push
myself forward. My Lord Kilcroney is an Irishman and
no courtier, and their Majesties have their own favourites;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
and indeed to begin with, I doubt whether you will find
it so easy to resign.”</p>

<p>“Resign, Kitty! Resign? No, dear Kilcroney, I
am on the point of being graciously dismissed. It took
some management, but I was desperate. Another month
of this, I said, and Mr. Stamer will be able to look out for
a new wife—which he would do, my dear love, across my
very coffin—’twas yesterday sennight then, I made up
my mind. I took my best rose-point flounce—by the
mercy of heaven it was just returned from the lace-menders,
neatly packed in tissue tied with ribbon and a
scent bag within, as elegant a parcel as you could wish
to see!—and I sought Mrs. Schwellenberg—aye, that
same!—and says I, ‘For mercy’s sake, give me a chair.
My poor feet will scarce support me?’ At which she
looks as sour as a crab, and quoth she: ‘We all have
veet, Lady Florence’ (you know her vile accent), ‘but
we forget dem in our great honour and brivilege,’ ‘Would
God I could forget mine,’ thinks I. But she glances at
the parcel in my hand: ‘Take a zeat,’ she says with a
roll of her old eye. ‘Ah, my good Frau,’ says I to
myself, ‘you may look, but you shan’t clutch yet a
bit!’”</p>

<p>Lady Florence laughed reminiscently, and Kitty
screamed:</p>

<p>“Never tell me you gave the old Dutch villain your
rose-point flounce!”</p>

<p>“And what would be the good of a rose-point flounce
to me, when I should be dropped dead in the Queen’s
apartment, like any hackney jade? My love, I showed
that ancient toad my two feet—and I vow toad is a good
name for her, for she hath the countenance and the
croak of her own pet frogs—I showed her my feet, and I
lamented my stones of weight. ’Pon rep! I gave myself
sixteen, I did indeed, and what with the swelling, I
looked ’em! ‘Let me confide in you,’ I cries, ‘if ever I
saw a truly noble soul writ on a human brow, ’tis on
yours! My frame,’ I cries, ‘is not equal to my devotion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
My ankles will not support the loyalty of my heart! ’tis
not that I should grudge passing away in such service,’
I cries, turning up my eyes—You could not have done it
better, Kitty!—‘but were I to faint in those sacred
precincts, were I to pass away in that august Presence,
Her Majesty would be justly annoyed. Dr. Jebb has
warned me. Alas! look at me. Am I not fat?’ ‘Vat
you are,’ says she, ‘but so am I.’ Well, then, my love, I
gave her a peep of the lace, and she began to dribble at
the corners of her mouth, and I knew the trick was done!
‘If I speak to Her Majesty,’ says she, and she fingering
my rose-point, ‘I vonder vot substitute I could suggest.
Her Majesty she does not like the changes, and——’
And then, I thought of you, Kitty.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why, in the name of Heaven!” cried this
lady tartly.</p>

<p>“Your feet won’t swell, my love.”</p>

<p>“I need not accept,” quoth Kitty, pinching her
lips.</p>

<p>“Kitty, if you play your cards well, the post will be
offered to you while their Majesties are here at Cheltenham.
’Tis all settled with the Schwellenberg. Do you
not know,” said Lady Florence, pushing the dish with a
single remaining macaroon upon it, virtuously from her,
“that Susan Verney is making all the interest in the
world for the honour? But she was rude to the Schwellenberg
one day—you know poor Susan’s way!—when
they met in my drawing-room at Queen’s Lodge, and the
Schwellenberg will have none of her!”</p>

<p>“Say no more!” cried Kitty, and fires shot from her
eyes.</p>

<p>“My love, I believe I have served you,” said Lady
Florence, replying to the eloquence of that glance. “‘My
royals are not bartial to the Irish,’ said Schwellenberg.
‘Ah, but Madam,’ I says. ‘My Lady Kilcroney is not
Irish. She is true-born English, and has vast wealth—widow
of an Indian Nabob—vast wealth and a generous
heart!—And you admire the lace, Madam?’ says I,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
‘in the very truth I was hoping I might venture to offer
it to you, for ’tis lace that should be worn at court,
Madam, and in no other place—and as I mentioned to
you, my Lady Kilcroney and her Lord have practically
severed all ties with Ireland. If you would accept the
flounce, Madam, on my retirement (I think there is a
narrow edging of rose-point to match).’ ‘I will tink of
what you say about my Lady Kilcroney,’ croaks she.
Am I not a good friend, Kitty?”</p>

<p>She looked at Kitty with such beaming kindness that
all this latter’s caprices vanished; she cast herself affectionately
on Lady Florence’s huge bosom and voted that
she was indeed the best and dearest!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was agreed between them before the large and
jovial lady left the pleasant apartments overlooking the
meadows, that she would call early next morning, and
report the result of Mrs. Schwellenberg’s “tinking,” since
she had been given to understand that Her Majesty would
deliver her gracious dismissal that evening, during the
process of the Royal disrobing.</p>

<p>“You must hold yourself ready, my sweet child, to be
at any point considered suitable along Her Majesty’s
path during the next few days. By the looks Her
Majesty casts on me I am convinced Schwellenberg has
kept her word, and prepared the ground ’ere we left
Queen’s Lodge. Well, she knew she would not get the
rose-point otherwise.”</p>

<p>Kitty stood reflecting in the bow-window long after
Lady Florence’s chairmen had reeled away with their
burden towards Lord Fauconberg’s small house on the
hill, which had been placed at their Majesties’ disposal.
It could not be said that she had quite so altogether consuming
a desire for the post of Lady-in-Waiting since
hearing Lady Florence’s talk and gazing on those swollen
feet, but, rather than that Susan Verney—dark, overbearing
Susan!—should have the advantage, Kitty would
have stood on burning ploughshares. She had, thank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Heaven, as good health as any lady in the kingdom, a
back that was never tired, and a fund of humour and
good humour that made her equal to most trials. Moreover
she had a fighting spirit, and, she flattered herself,
a charm of her own. If she did not get the better of
Schwellenberg on the one hand, and ingratiate herself
with Royalty on the other, then she was no longer Incomparable
Bellairs!</p>

<p>Her agreeable reflections were broken in upon by the
entrance of my Lord Kilcroney.</p>

<p>Now, hot-blooded, red-headed Irishman as he was, it
was the rarest thing in the world for this nobleman to be
seriously out of temper with anyone, let alone with the
wife of his bosom; but, as he flung himself into Kitty’s
hired parlour, he was in as irate a mood as he had ever
indulged in, and that with his Lady.</p>

<p>“Here’s a pretty business!” quoth he, and cast his
hat on the table in the middle of the room, very nearly
dislodging the glass dome which protected a gold filigree
basket containing the most purple plums, the reddest
strawberries, the bluest grapes that ever artist in wax
produced. “Here’s a pretty to-do!” cried Denis
Kilcroney.</p>

<p>“There seems indeed to be a to-do!” retorted
Kitty. She wheeled round from the window. “But
you will condescend to explain the cause perhaps, my
Lord?”</p>

<p>“So I hear you’ve got a place about the court, me
darling,” said Denis, plunging into sarcasm, with a
flushed countenance. “’Pon me soul, ’tis the grand
lady you’re going to be entirely! ’Tis the back seat
your husband will have to be taking. Glory be to
God, what’s a husband? And an Irish one into the
bargain!”</p>

<p>“Pray, my Lord,” cried Kitty, all eagerness. “Where
have you heard the news? For, as I’m a living woman,
’tis news to me.”</p>

<p>“Ah! go on out of that.” My Lord was certainly very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
angry, and more than usually Hibernian. “Didn’t that
fat baggage come straight out of these doors? Didn’t
she put that full moon face of hers out of the sedan
window and bawl to her men to stop, and them with
the sweat dripping off them, God help them! And ‘oh,’
she calls, ‘My Lord Kilcroney,’ she cries, ‘’tis quite
settled,’ she says. ‘And your Kitty to take my post
about Her Majesty.’ Why, all Cheltenham could have
heard her.”</p>

<p>“Tush!” Kitty’s peach-tinted countenance, agog
with delight, fell. “Is that all? Why——” she was
about to expound to Denis with some firmness the folly
of giving way to passion over an event that was still in
the uncertain future, at the same time conveying to him
her clear intention to leave no stone unturned towards
its accomplishment, when her little black page appeared
at the open door, grinning at the sounds of dispute, and
announced: “Mistress Lafone.” And if the sight of
dusky innocence amused was exasperating to my Lady,
what can be said of the feelings aroused by the smile of
minxish artfulness?</p>

<p>“Good heavens,” cried Kitty. “And what brings
you to Cheltenham, if one may ask?”</p>

<p>“Good-morrow, my sweet Kilcroney.”</p>

<p>This familiarity!</p>

<p>“Good-morrow, Madam.” Kitty swept a curtsy to
mark her distance, the while my Lord kissed the creature’s
hand, positively as if he liked doing so, and him but out
of such a tantrum as never was.</p>

<p>“And what should bring me to Cheltenham—(no,
my Lord, pray. I prefer the little stool. I do indeed)—why
should not poor little me be here with the
rest?”</p>

<p>“Why, indeed?” growled Kilcroney.</p>

<p>“And what has brought you, my Lady, if one may
inquire?”</p>

<p>“She thought little Denis looked pale!” cried my
Lord, and gave a great guffaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“You may laugh, Madam,” said Kitty, as Mrs. Lafone
tinkled delicately. “There are feelings which only a
mother can understand.”</p>

<p>Mistress Lafone was childless.</p>

<p>“One excuse will serve as well as another.” My
Lord let himself fall into a chair that creaked threateningly
beneath his weight.</p>

<p>“Oh, I seek for no excuse,” quoth Molly Lafone.
Crouching on the low stool, she had a singular air of
astuteness, in spite of her fostered childishness. “I
never can understand why people should not tell the
truth.” She raised arch eyes towards my Lord, while
Kitty sat with the majesty of an Eastern idol, and had
not as much as the quiver of an eyelash.</p>

<p>“I’m here to curry favour with royalty,” she laughed
again sweetly, “like the rest of us!”</p>

<p>The brazenness of it! My Lord guffawed again. He
certainly was in a most unpleasant mood.</p>

<p>“Huthen. I hope you’ll be as successful as my Lady
there!”</p>

<p>“Oh! My Lady Kilcroney!...”</p>

<p>“Sure, isn’t it the surprise of her life.” Kilcroney
once again waded heavily in sarcasm. “She hadn’t as
much as the faintest notion such a thing could happen
to her—had you, me Lady? She hadn’t as much as
opened her mouth for the plum”—it was perhaps the
purple artifice on the table that suggested the simile—“but
didn’t it drop into it? It’s going to be Lady-in-Waiting
she is, in place of my Lady Flo——”</p>

<p>“Oh! my Lord, say you so? Says he right, my
dearest Lady Kilcroney? ’Tis the most splendid, the
most monstrous delightful news I’ve heard this long
time. Oh!” cried Mrs. Lafone, clasping and wringing
her hands in an ecstasy. “May not your little Molly
rejoice with you?”</p>

<p>“You are vastly disinterested,” said Kitty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lafone gave her tinkling laugh.</p>

<p>“Ah, my Lady—indeed, my Lord, I have said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
I am frank. Dearest Lady Kilcroney, I will be frank—If
I could obtain some little post—the teeniest, weeniest
little post at court——”</p>

<p>But Kitty interrupted, bouncing out of her stateliness.</p>

<p>“Pray, Mrs. Lafone, for what post should you consider
yourself qualified about the august person of our gracious
Queen?”</p>

<p>“Oh! My Lady Kilcroney, the least little post in all
the world! Hath not the Queen appointed a plain Miss
Burney reader? I believe I could very well be reader.
Mr. Lafone says I have a silver tone in my voice, and
our curate at home once told me——”</p>

<p>“Tush, the celebrated Miss Burney hath qualifications,
child, which you in your foolishness fail to
appreciate.”</p>

<p>“Yet she is but a music teacher’s daughter, Madam,”
said Molly with a mighty sigh. She dropped her white
eyelids and turned a green glint on my Lord, and sighed
again. “Or if not actually about her Majesty—who
am I, indeed, to aspire to that Presence?—some office
about yourself, dear Lady Kilcroney. I would be
your secretary, your Lady-in-waiting, your devoted
attendant!”</p>

<p>“This is folly,” cried Kitty. “I am by no means
appointed to my Lady Flo’s post, and if I were—well,
to be frank with you, Lafone, since you like frankness so
much—you are the last person in the world I should
ever be instrumental in bringing to court. Heavens!”
cried Kitty, gazing upwards at the low ceiling, as if she
saw through it into the celestial regions. “What discretion,
what faultless propriety of conduct, what a
delicate sense of responsibility, what a blameless record
should be demanded of one who would enter that sacred
circle!...”</p>

<p>(It was the glint of her visitor’s green eye at
my Lord which gave this stern decision to Kitty’s
tones.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>Here, quite unexpectedly, and with admirable effectiveness,
large tears rose in Mrs. Lafone’s eyes and rolled
down her cheeks, without in the least disturbing the
prettiness of her pointed visage. My Lord cast a
glance from one to the other; it was lit with a tender
sympathy as it fell on this touching impersonation
of grief, and kindled with reproach as it shot to
Kitty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lafone gave a small sob.</p>

<p>“Your sweet lady,” she said, now audaciously addressing
her male champion, “has ever been a friend in
need. ’Tis for that, that I have ventured, my Lord,
that I have ventured to come to her to-day, hearing—yes!
I will own it, I already knew that she was like to
be next in the Queen’s choice. I made the journey
hither in the hopes—’tis for no reason of petty vanity,
no mere envious ambition——” (Thus the minx) ... “oh!
my Lord, I scarce know why, I have ever been
sadly persecuted. I am the victim of evil tongues!... My
reputation has been assailed....”</p>

<p>“Ha!” said Kitty. The ejaculation leaped from
her.</p>

<p>Molly Lafone produced another silver sob. “Quite
unfoundedly, I do assure you! My conscience is spotless,
my Lady Kilcroney, spotless!”—she caught Kitty’s
eye, and went on in a humble voice—“in this instance!
Indeed, my Lady—but Mr. Lafone—I am sadly maligned,
he is suspicious, he——” Here the unfortunate young
woman became quite incoherent in her demonstrations
of distress. She wrung her white hands with extra
pathos. Another large tear flowed, and a volley of little
sobbing, disjointed phrases accompanied it, “domestic
happiness—ignorance of the world—poor little me,
country-bred and guileless—salvation or despair!”</p>

<p>In the midst, Kitty rose, returning to majesty.</p>

<p>“I must put a stop to a scene so useless and so painful.
How is it possible, Madam, you do not see that every
word you utter but marks the impossibility of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
request? Pray, my Lord, see Mistress Lafone to her
chair.”</p>

<p>“Kitty!” cried Kilcroney, springing to his feet. He
had not thought it of her, to requite these open-hearted
confidences with insult; to turn so trusting and touching
a creature into the street; a lady—an old friend! “Pray
Mistress Lafone, let us be offering you a dish of tea,”
cried he.</p>

<p>There are days when everything goes askew. Kitty’s
great footman marched into the room and presented his
mistress with a letter which, he said, had just been brought
by a riding messenger. Kitty took it from the salver
with all the air of one glad of the diversion, but no sooner
had she perused it than she exclaimed, in tones of such
consternation, that my Lord leant forward and took it
out of her hand. He exclaimed in his turn, but in accents
of pleasure.</p>

<p>“Why, what is this? Sure, Alanna, there is naught
here to upset you, ’tis the best of good fortune on the
contrary! Here’s your sweet friend, my Lady Mandeville,
actually at Malvern and proposing to drive over
and spend the day with you to-morrow, bringing her
little rogue to play with ours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is intolerable,” cried Kitty, “this is past
bearing! Bid the messenger wait. Good heavens, do
I not hear him riding away?—Call him back, my Lord,
call him back! On no account must my Lady Mandeville
be permitted to visit me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>My Lord stood rooted to the spot, and the veins
on his forehead swelled. Kitty rushed to the window
and hailed vigorously; the rhythmic footfalls of a
horse receding at slow pace along the cobble stones
was, on a sudden, altered to the clatter of a returning
trot.</p>

<p>“Damnation!” cried my Lord. “This passes all!”</p>

<p>Mistress Lafone had stopped the wringing of hands
and the production of tears, and was all malicious
interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Kilcroney had entered into a towering passion. He
protested that it was the most monstrous low thing,
that he forbade my Lady to behave so base to her friend.</p>

<p>“Tare an’ ’ounds!” cried he, “if it wasn’t ashamed
you were, and that, not a minute ago, to be enjoying the
finest hospitality in the world, the kindest, the most
open-hearted, ’tis not ashamed you should be to return a
thrifle of it! Shame!” ejaculated Denis. “Shame!
’tis on the other leg. Gad, ’tis the shameful bit of meanness
you’d be practising and ’tis ashamed I am of you
meself (that I should live to say it). Your best friend!
And all for what? For what if ye please? For the
favour of them that never as much as acknowledged
your existence. ’Pon me soul, rather than wound the
feelings of that angel upon earth, that fair, fond, gentle,
noble creature——” My Lord’s voice cracked. “I’d
see the whole of Windsor, and Kew to boot, tumble into
the Liffey.”</p>

<p>Kitty, white under her delicate smears of rouge, sat
down at her writing-table with the most sublime air of
offended virtue, but the hand that dipped the pen into
the ink shook, and there were tears in the voice which
presently declared that if ever there was woman here
maligned by her own husband, it was my Lady Kilcroney:
she who had not liked to disturb her Lord, but who had
nevertheless noticed a red spot behind their darling little
Denis’s ear that very morning; which spot, as every one
who was a mother knew, might very well betoken no less
a malady than the measles, which malady, being highly
infectious to young children, she, as a mother, now felt
it her duty to put off her cherished Lady Mandeville
and the adored little Impington to a more auspicious
day.</p>

<p>“Spot!” interrupted my Lord, with a roar between
derision and wrath, and</p>

<p>“Spot?” cooed Mistress Lafone, now letting herself
go openly to insolence. “My dearest Lady Kilcroney,
you are too droll!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>There was contempt written on the countenances of
the pair so odiously conjoined against Kitty; neither
of them being subtle enough to see that my Lady was
content with any excuse, so long as it flung a veil of
elegance over her set purpose.</p>

<p>This incomparable woman recovered herself, rose,
summoned Pompey, and sent him forth with her letter
to my Lord Mandeville’s groom. She watched its delivery,
through the window, and having beheld the man start
off again, returned to the centre of the room, made in
silence a profound curtsy, which included her Lord and
her visitor, and sailed forth, closing the door carefully
behind her.</p>

<p>My Lord let himself fall again into the arm-chair, and
once more this article of furniture protested with ominous
creaks and cracks.</p>

<p>“There’s not a stick in the place, bejabers, that isn’t
as rotten as pears. ’Pon my word,” grumbled Denis
Kilcroney, “I wish the plaguey waters had never been
discovered, I do indeed; ’tis a poor thing when a man’s
own son and heir is made a weapon against him, and him
but turned of three. ‘Little Denis is pale, and we must
to Cheltenham. And we’ll lie at Lady Mandeville’s,
which is on our way, my love’ (and it thirty miles out,
taking the back and the forth of it). ‘And our little Denis
will have a playfellow, ’twill be so vastly good for him.
Little Impington and he will be comrades.’ And scarce
are we settled at Impington Court with as good entertainment—aye—and
as generous (’tis the cellar of the world
my Lord Mandeville has, and ’tis as free with it he is—troth,
as I’d be meself if my Lady’d let me, and I can give
him no finer character!) No sooner are we settled, and
scarce a cork drawn ye may say, but ’tis ‘Little Impington
is too rough for our darling Denis. He will teach him ill
ways, he will do him a hurt. And Impington Court is a
thought too low for the child’s health. And we must
move on to Cheltenham, my love, or there will not be a
lodging to be had.’ And you should have seen the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
farewells, the clingings, the embracings, and the tears,
and heard the promises. ‘We shall meet again soon, my
dearest, dearest Rachel. I vow I’ll not be parted from
the most cherished of my friends!’ And now ’tis: ‘Keep
away—little Denis hath a spot!’ To be sure, our dearest
Rachel must not cast a blight over my Lady’s Court
prospects.”</p>

<p>“But why, pray you, why, my Lord Kilcroney, should
my Lady Mandeville cast a blight? Is she not in the
Court favour?”</p>

<p>Mistress Molly’s tones were as insinuating as the fillet
of sweetness that issues from a flute; nevertheless, Denis,
starting from his black mood, gave her a sudden odd
look.</p>

<p>“Prithee, why, my Lord?”</p>

<p>Kitty was in the right of it. The little jade was as
false as loaded dice! As if every one did not know poor
Rachel’s story; how she had been a Quaker and an
actress, and my Lord Mandeville’s mistress before she
had been his wife; and how, save for that one stain,
which, indeed, had been the fall of a pure woman
piteously and devotedly in love, she had ever shone
in a wicked world, the noblest example to her
sex.</p>

<p>Mistress Lafone caught my Lord’s look upon her and
deemed it time to depart. Without waiting, therefore,
for his reply to her question, she feigned horror at the
lateness of the hour, and bustled away from the Kilcroney
lodgings, malcontent with her visit, the more so that my
Lord Kilcroney brought a wooden countenance and a
dry manner to the very hall door.</p>

<p>She went forth down the single street and across the
meadows; for her rooms were in an out-of-the-way
cottage, far from the fashionable quarter patronised by
the well-to-do. Mrs. Lafone’s fortunes were indeed at a
low ebb. Her elderly, niggardly husband had vowed
some time ago that he would pay no more debts for her,
and he was keeping his vow. In her efforts at self-extrication,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
Mistress Molly, not having a scrupulous
delicacy of conduct, had become further considerably
entangled. A scandal threatened which might be the
undoing of her. And there was my Lady Kilcroney not
only declining to help her, but as good as turning her out
of the house!</p>

<p>Molly Lafone was sharp of scent as a weasel. It was
unpleasantly clear to her that the irate great lady was
determined to seize the first opportunity of cutting her
altogether; and when my Lady Kilcroney, leader of
society as she was, cast her off, she would be lost indeed!
She had no thought in her breast, as she walked along
the road between the flat fields, but the longing to pay
Kitty out.</p>

<p>The way was deserted. Evening shadows were
lengthening across the mellowness of the sun-steeped
plain. Molly Lafone slackened her pace. Why, indeed,
should she hurry back to the stuffy little room where she
could afford herself no better supper than bread and
milk?</p>

<p>Truly, if there are angels who reward the virtuous,
there must be little demons who provide dainties for
those who serve the ways of evil! There, just at her
feet, shining quite golden in the rays of the setting sun,
lay a letter.</p>

<p>It lay so that its superscription was visible, and Molly
could hardly believe her eyes when she read in Kitty’s
writing the words: “For the hand of my Lady, the
Countess Mandeville.”</p>

<p>“The careless fellow,” said she, “he’s dropped it from
his belt as he jogged along. Pshaw, how I hate a clumsy
fool!”</p>

<p>Then she laughed shrilly. “My Lady Mandeville will
never get her Kitty’s affectionate answer, nor hear how
little Denis hath a spot, and she will come driving in
to-morrow to hang herself and her tarnished name round
Kitty’s neck for all Cheltenham to see, under the nose of
the virtuous Queen Charlotte. That is very well done!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
cried Molly. “That is a very fit punishment for such
base intentions. I am very glad.”</p>

<p>And lest anyone should be busybody enough to pick
up the dropped letter and forward it to its destination,
which would be a sad interference with the just action of
Providence, Mistress Lafone picked it up herself and
minced it into small pieces as she walked along towards her
cottage lodging. She had quite a good appetite for her
bread and milk that night.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It had been my Lady Kilcroney’s intention to keep
her cherished little Denis in his cot, for the space of at
least a day, for indeed there was more than one red mark
on the satin of his small, plump body, and Kitty vowed
it was of a piece with the rest of my Lord’s brutality to
declare that those who leave their own homes for the
discomforts of lodgings must expect the occasional flea.
But on receipt of a letter sent round by my Lady Flora’s
woman, she promptly altered her plans, and ordered the
protesting cherub to be arrayed in his best robe-coat
covered with fine muslin, and his white satin hat with
feathers.</p>

<p>My Lord, as soon as his infant’s roars had been soothed
by candies, picked up the letter which Kitty had dropped
on the floor in her hurried exit to her bed-chamber; and,
while his Lady was alternately pealing at her bell and
shouting for Lydia, without compunction read it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>My Dearest Lady Kilcroney: ’Tis all arranged.
I consider my freedom well purchased at the price of the
rose-point flounce, and the service to a friend, no less, by
the trimmings to match. Her Majesty received me in her
closet last evening, and the matter was settled quick. I
must confess, dearest Kitty, with all the</i> veneration <i>and</i>
love (these words were heavily underlined) <i>that I cherish
for her August Person, I did feel it hard to find that my
poor feet were represented as the dropsy. Dropsy, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
love. And I but turned of thirty! ‘You should have
warned me,’ said Her Majesty, ‘that you were suffering
from a disease.’ ‘Ma’am,’ said I, ‘if disease there is’—(I
was afraid to deny it, dear Kitty, lest the fetters should
not be struck off my aching ankles)—‘’twas contracted in
Your Majesty’s service.’ And now if my Kilcroney has
a taste for gilded slavery (though there’s less gilding than
you would believe), let her be at the entrance of the pump
room, to receive Her Majesty at the head of the other lady
visitors, on her first visit thither this very morning at
eleven o’clock. The Gentlemen-in-Waiting are informing
the other notabilities of the town, and Her Majesty is prepared
for the little ceremony which she desires shall have
the appearance of an Impromptu, it being her wish to
avoid state during the Royal Visit and not to be incommoded
by the crowd. If your little Denis were to offer a bunch of
roses, it would, I think, please the Queen, who likes to see
ladies occupied of their children and is interested in any
who are about the age of the Princess Amelia. From
what Mrs. Schwellenberg—oh! Kitty, to think of that
toad festooned about with my lace—hath wrote to me
(thank God we have left the</i> frog-fancier <i>behind at Windsor)
I understand you can consider the appointment as good
as made——</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>The letter dropped from Kilcroney’s hand. His good-natured
face (for in spite of tantrums he was to the core
a man of good nature), clouded with genuine dismay.
It looked as if the plaguey business, which he had
regarded in the light of a mere game, was like to turn
to earnest.</p>

<p>Why, in the name of Heaven, a woman with all the
world could give her, and a devoted husband besides,
should break up her family life for the pleasures of an
annual three months’ slavery—Lady Florence had well
named it—passed his comprehension.</p>

<p>“Nay, Lydia,” Kitty’s voice was uplifted in the other
room, “take back the tabby; aye, and the satin cloak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
from Madame Mirabel’s. I have thought better of it,
child. Put away the Eglantine new hat with the
feathers. I will wear muslin and a plain straw. I wish
to Heaven,” cried Kitty pettishly, “that there was a
milliner in the Kingdom who could run up a hat
to suit a lady’s eyelashes or the tilt of her nose outside
Paris.”</p>

<p>“There’s the Italian straw we bought last time we was
staying over there at Madame the Duchess’s,” said Lydia
tentatively; “the same your ladyship ordered for yourself
to wear at the <i>Feet</i> at Trianon to which the French
Queen asked us—and a sweet elegant creature Her Majesty
is, with all her fancies for dairies and such—and the
thunderstorm coming on it was the disappointment of
the world, and one that I am not like to forget in a hurry!
Sure your ladyship ain’t forgotten it? A plain rice
straw, with a ribbon round, but with a set to it! Aye,
and trimmed by my blood-niece, as is apprenticed to
Madame Eglantine out of my own poor savings; me
being always one to stand by my family, cost what it
do.”</p>

<p>“The Italian straw,” my Lady reflected; “’twas
monstrous thoughtful of you, child, to pack it—la,
Lydia, ’tis the very thing—trimmed by your niece did
you say? Nay, only the genius of Eglantine could
twist a bow like that. Put it on my head. Why, ’tis
perfect—aye, I will wear it. Her Majesty desires
simplicity.”</p>

<p>“Simplicity, is it?” Kilcroney groaned. “God help
us all!”</p>

<p>As Kitty sallied forth, all in vapoury white, fresh and
sweet as a privet blossom, her face delicately pink under
the artful shepherdess hat, Pompey following with the
great rose-bunch in a bandbox, and little Denis trotting
alongside scarlet-cheeked from a triumphant battle royal
over the wearing of gloves, my Lord looked after them
with some melancholy.</p>

<p>“I’ll stroll along presently and keep in the background.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
I’d not like to be blighting Kitty’s prospects after the
fashion of yonder poor Rachel. By all accounts Her
gracious Majesty Queen Charlotte is no more like to
fancy an Irishman than the unhappy girl that has a
mistake to her name.”</p>

<p>Kitty had determined to walk to the pump room.
’Twas scarce a hundred yards away, and “squeeze those
crisp flounces into a chair before they had served their
purpose—never!” She had taken but a few steps along
the street when who should cross her but Mrs. Lafone.
Molly, all in the modesty of lilac dimity, with pensiveness,
something even approaching penitence, on her pert face.
Kitty was in a fair humour, and as her little enemy flung
her a deprecating glance of green eyes, actually paused
and smiled.</p>

<p>“Whither away, Lafone?”</p>

<p>“Alas, my Lady Kilcroney, stepping into the pump
room anon to drink my glass of the waters, I heard as
how Her Majesty was expected, and how you and the
other ladies of note are to receive her on this, her first
appearance.... My Lady Kilcroney, knowing myself
so unfit, feeling myself so out of spirits, I deemed it more
becoming to retire till all was over.”</p>

<p>Now Kitty, riding on the top of the wave, was a trifle
intoxicated. It was in a tone of almost Royal patronage
that she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why should you miss the sight, child? You could
very well find a little place where you could see and not
be seen. Retrace your steps with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! My Lady Kilcroney,” cries Molly, with her
dramatic clasp of the hands, “was there ever anyone so
truly benevolent as you are!”</p>

<p>Hanging her head, the little minx started off, a humble
step behind her patroness, and, looking over his shoulder
at her, Denis the younger was fascinated by the wicked
mockery on her face, and nearly fell into a puddle for
staring.</p>

<p>There was no excitement in the town, for Her Majesty’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
intention was known but to the favoured few. The
Royal Family, it was bruited, were still reposing from the
fatigues of their journey. There was, however, a small
group of gentlemen about the pump room doors, in elegant
morning attire, and two or three barouches and as many
chairs were in the very act of depositing their fair burdens
as Lady Kilcroney sailed up. She was just in time,
indeed, to see Lady Verney—black-browed Susan,
panting, flushed, incredibly plumed—hurl herself out of
her hired sedan. At sight of Kitty this personage halted
in her rush forward into the pump room.</p>

<p>“You here, dear Kilcroney?” her voice shook.
There was fury in her eye.</p>

<p>“Even so, dear Verney. Pray, my Lord Courtown,
shall I take my stand on this spot? Hither with the
flowers, Pompey. My little son is to offer these to Her
Majesty, Colonel Digby; certainly ’twould be a mercy
if you would have the kindness to hold them till the
right moment comes. Such tender years are scarcely
to be trusted!—Nay, Denis, lambkin, no more sugar
plums till we get home again, or little pandies would be
so sticky, Denis couldn’t give the nosegay to the beautiful
Queen—What a pity, my dearest Susan, you should have
made yourself so fine. By Her Majesty’s most express
wish, all is to have the appearance of the simplest impromptu!
Still, my skirts are fairly wide. If you
place yourself behind me——”</p>

<p>Place herself behind Kitty! Had her beloved friend
run mad, she that was always so flighty? My Lady
Verney to place herself in the rear, be hidden by another’s
flounces, she who had posted day and night, all the way
from Hertfordshire, upon the news of a probable vacancy
about the Queen’s person! Was it possible that Kitty,
with her Irish husband, labelled with such a name, could
fancy that she was like to meet with the Queen’s favour?
Susan was sorry for her poor friend. She tossed her
head with a snort. My Lady Verney had something of
the appearance of a handsome horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>But stupefaction succeeded indignation when Lord
Courtown, very civilly addressing her, begged her to take
her place with the other ladies in the rear of my Lady
Kilcroney, for the royal party might be expected any
moment.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Tracy, ma’am, as one conversant in these
matters, will you stand at my Lady’s elbow?—My Lady
Kilcroney, Mrs. Tracy—Her Majesty’s Senior Bedchamber
Woman, who is at the waters on her own
account.”</p>

<p>My Lady Verney, biting her lip, stamped heavily on
her neighbour’s foot as she shifted her position. Turning
at the low cry, her fierce black eyes met the plaintive
green ones of Mrs. Lafone, who in spite of her discreet
protestations, had taken as forward a place in the group
as well she could. As a rule Molly was in no better
favour with Susan Verney than with the rest of the
coterie, but at that moment they shared a sentiment
which made them suddenly and momentarily sympathetic.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Lady Verney,” whispered Molly, “did you
ever see anyone so sadly cocked up as our poor Kitty?
It frightens me for her, it does indeed. I fear such pride
must have a fall.”</p>

<p>Although Susan could see no sign of this prognostication
being fulfilled, it comforted her nevertheless;
and she was able to bear, with a better equanimity
than any who knew her would have thought possible,
the painful spectacle of my Lady Kilcroney’s success
with the Queen. Success it indubitably was, though
Her Majesty was a dry woman and not given to displays
of affability. It was evident that she had come
prepared to be pleased with Kitty Kilcroney and that
pleased she found herself. And truly, Kitty in her
snowy flounces, so charmingly blushing under her
wide-brimmed hat—which was indeed trimmed by
Lydia’s niece, Miss Pamela Pounce—Kitty so daintily
maternal with the sturdy little boy clutching his roses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
was as pretty a picture as any would wish to gaze
upon.</p>

<p>The two blooming Princesses exclaimed upon the
darling child, and good-natured Lady Flo was one broad
beam behind “her Royals’” back. And if Kitty blushed
she had nevertheless the most elegant ease. Her curtsy
was a model; the dignified modesty with which she
advanced and then retreated within the due measure
of etiquette was perfect of its kind. And when the
incident took place, which might indeed have proved
awkward, of Master Denis declining to part with his posy,
his mother saved the situation. “Denis,” quoth she,
bending but not whispering; all with a modest assurance
that could not have been bettered by one who had
been years at Court. “Lambkin, do you not remember
what I bid you? To whom were you to offer these
flowers?”</p>

<p>“To the beautiful Queen,” said the child, his great
brown eyes roaming about as if he were seeking—as well
he might, poor innocent!—whom the description might
fit. The Queen, with a flattered smile, herself took the
offering from his chubby fingers.</p>

<p>“Pretty rogue!” said Princess Augusta.</p>

<p>When the other introductions had been gone through
it seemed to be nobody’s business to present Mistress
Lafone; and though the equerries looked tentatively at
her and then at my Lady Kilcroney, nothing could be
less responsive than that usually alert being. So Molly
made an artless curtsy as became her simplicity, and
thought, in her disloyal heart, how frumpish and dowdy
Her Majesty looked; and wondered if ’twas Miss Burney
who appeared so shortsighted and awkward and timid,
with no more air than nothing at all. And save for the
gentlemen, who were very personable and had bright
looks about them as if they might be enjoyable company
to a woman of spirit, there was really naught in this
vision of the Court which would make her, little Molly,
yearn for it—a vast stiffness and dullness indeed! If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
it had not been that needs must when the devil drives
she would have snapped her slender fingers and ‘thank
you,’ but as matters stood—the drowning do not
pause to contemplate the quality of the spar flung to
them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lafone looked vindictively at Kitty and then
turned a watchful glance at the door. She wondered
how soon and in what circumstances Kitty’s dearest
friend, who was not received at Court, might make her
appearance? However Kitty might strive to hide the
visit, Mrs. Lafone would take care that it should be
known of; she had but to whisper the fact to my Lady
Verney and she did not doubt that the Royal occupants
of Fauconberg Hall would promptly be in possession of
the damning fact. Other people could put spokes in
wheels besides my Lady Kilcroney; and the more
swiftly they were rolling to favour, the greater might be
the upset!</p>

<p>Her Majesty, talking very affably to Kitty, had advanced
towards the counter where the waters were
distributed. Here divers magnates of the town were
awaiting her, whom the Comptroller of the Household,
my Lord Courtown, named to her, one after the other.
Kitty and her group of ladies were left thus for the
moment outside the Royal circle of attention. The hall
by this time contained a certain amount of curious
spectators, very respectfully aligned against the walls,
for the public of Cheltenham, genteel quiet folk, would
have died rather than presume on Her Majesty’s condescending
informality.</p>

<p>“Pray,” said the Queen, to Mr. Clark, the town doctor,
“let me have a taste of the water, sir, to drink which the
King has been sent hither. I ought at least to know,”
she added archly, “to what penance he hath been
condemned.”</p>

<p>She sipped and declared she had expected worse;
Princess Royal and Princess Augustus also sipped, but
they cried out and protested that they were sorry for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
dear papa. And while the Royal pleasantries were producing
the most exquisite if refined mirth throughout
the whole assembly, Mrs. Lafone, who had been conscious
that she was the object of considerable interest to one of
the equerries (indeed, he was lifting his quizzing glass
to mark his notice), perceived his glance wander from
herself and become fixed. He dropped his quizzing glass,
the better to see; a warmth of wondering admiration,
prodigiously different from the familiar ogle she had herself
evoked, wrote itself on his countenance. But for the
presence of Royalty, she thought he might have exclaimed
out loud. Molly’s glance promptly followed his. She
could hardly believe her eyes. Here was fate playing
her game with a vengeance. Her enemy was delivered
into her hands. Everyone knew the face of Rachel
Peace!</p>

<p>My Lady Mandeville advanced, clad, like Kitty herself,
in white, but with a flutter of grey ribbons here and there
to mark her Quaker preference. Her delicate pale face
was faintly flushed, under the wide brim of her simple
hat. She was not less fair than the pearls at her throat,
not less shining in delicate beauty. She held by the
hand a noble boy, slightly older than little Denis, who
marched as if the place belonged to him and gazed about
under frowning brows as though he wondered who dared
occupy it without his permission.</p>

<p>If Kitty made a charming picture with her little son,
Rachel, with the heir of Mandeville, graceful and gracious,
with a lovely tenderness emanating from her, was the
very embodiment of sweet motherhood.</p>

<p>She came across the wide hall with swift step, looking
from right to left, a smile hovering on her lips, her seeking
eyes already lit with fond pleasure. Where was her
dear Kitty? Suddenly she stopped—the smile faded,
the light of the expectant gaze went out, shadow fell
upon her radiance, a flutter as of fear shook her; yet she
had but encountered the gaze of my Lady Verney.
Susan Verney, who was very well acquainted with Rachel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Mandeville, who had indeed also tasted of her hospitality,
both in town and in the country, now withered her with
a blasting stare of denegration, a stare which said: “My
Lady Mandeville, I am pure virtue to-day, <i>I do not know
you</i>.”</p>

<p>The room was all eyes to look at Rachel, and though
so decorous it was all whispers.</p>

<p>The next moment the poor thing saw the Queen and
the Princesses, and Kitty Kilcroney white as death and
good Lady Flora scarlet in the face; she saw and understood.
Motionless she strove to rally her courage. She
wanted strength of heart and clearness of mind to do
just what would be right; Quaker Rachel who had never
done wrong but once! And for that breathless moment,
unknown to herself, her eyes hung on Kitty’s face; and
Kitty’s eyelids were cast down.</p>

<p>The little Viscount Impington tugged at her hand.
His was an impatient spirit.</p>

<p>“Come on, Mamma,” cried he, in loud authority;
and at the same moment little Denis O’Hara raised a
piping cry: “Imp, Imp, Imp!” and tearing himself
from the maternal clasp, galloped across the room to
hurl himself upon his baby comrade.</p>

<p>The Queen looked at Kitty with an air of profound
surprise and disapproval, and Kitty looked back at the
Queen. And her heart rose within her; for, with all
her foibles and fancies, she had a heart.</p>

<p>It led her then to do the noblest act of her whole
existence.</p>

<p>Holding herself very erect and moving with a beautiful
dignity, she slowly backed the length of the
room that divided her from Rachel Mandeville; and,
keeping her eyes on the Royal face the while, she took
her friend by the hand. Then she stood very upright
and waited. Rachel could do naught else but wait
too.</p>

<p>In the dead silence the Queen prepared to take her
departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Little Mr. O’Hara and my Lord Impington were
beginning to show signs of following up their affectionate
greeting with a rough-and-tumble fight and each
mother had to take possession of her child and keep
him firmly held; but they kept tighter hold of each
other still.</p>

<p>The Royal group advanced; the kindly young
Princesses with awed looks, as if they felt how ill things
were going without understanding. When she reached
my Lady Kilcroney and her friend, Queen Charlotte
paused and seemed to hesitate. She cast a strange
troubled glance at the two young women, and Kitty and
Rachel fell, still clasping hands, into a great curtsy.
And the question was, which of the two made it with
a nobler grace.</p>

<p>The last of the equerries to follow looked back at the
door, and saw my Ladies Mandeville and Kilcroney
embracing and kissing and he thought they were both
in tears.</p>

<p>My Lord Kilcroney had been among those who unobtrusively
joined the lookers-on in the pump room
during the Royal visitation, and, beholding the scene,
his own eyes filled. In the effort to regain his self-control
he turned his dimmed gaze away from the two
who enfolded each other in such affecting and unaffected
friendship and it fell upon Mistress Lafone. As awhile
ago his son and heir, he was fascinated by the expression
on the small pale visage. Molly caught his riveted
glance, wilted beneath it, and somehow vanished. Not
my Lord Kilcroney nor anyone could ever as much as
guess at her share in the morning’s business; yet so
does conscience make cowards of us all, as Mr. Shakespeare
has it.</p>

<p>My Lord kissed his wife’s hand before most respectfully
saluting that of my Lady Mandeville. At sight of him,
Kitty mingled laughter with her tears.</p>

<p>“Is it not delightful, Denis,” cried she, “that our
sweet Rachel should have had this happy thought?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
But, oh, my dear love, our little rascals are at fisticuffs
again!”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>My dear Kitty</i>,” wrote Lady Florence that evening,
in a letter brought round from Fauconberg Hall by
one of the pages in waiting, “<i>I thought you were dished,
I did indeed. And of all the odd tiresome</i> contretemps,
<i>my love!... Well, I have not time to say even a word
of what I felt: Her Majesty is not fond of audacities
and you did, dearest Kitty, the most audacious deed....
Well, never mind again!</i></p>

<p>“<i>’Twas your hat did the trick to begin with, my love;
you was always so clever about clothes, Kitty. Sure,
it was the finest inspiration to wear that modest country
straw with its plain ribbon. It caught Her Majesty’s
eye from the first moment, and that you know means so
much. So modest, sensible and quiet you showed beside
poor Susan! Susan, with that tow-row of feathers on
her head! ’Tis she who is dished after all: ‘A loud
young woman,’ says the Queen to me. ‘I do not approve
of Lady Verney’s style.’ And what must she do on the
top of it but present herself in my parlour at Fauconberg
Hall this very afternoon?—a vast piece of presumption,
since the Queen hath forbidden visitors to all and sundry!—And
wants an interview of Her Majesty, to apologise—prithee,
Kitty, think of it!—for Her Majesty’s having
been exposed to such a meeting. She, to apologise for
the town! She, to cast her stone at poor Rachel! I
have never known my Royal so angry! ‘Are you then
not acquainted with my Lady Mandeville?’ She asks
our Verney. You should have seen Susan’s face under
her red plumes. (I had taken good care Her Majesty
should know we</i> all <i>were.) To be brief, Kitty, Verney
went forth with her comb considerably cut, and Her
Majesty took a twist in the other direction and spoke
very kind to me; though regretting the incident, she said
she could not find too grave a fault with a display of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
loyalty. ‘Tell my Lady Kilcroney,’ she says, ‘that
about My Person I appreciate loyalty!</i>’”</p>
</div>

<p>Denis Kilcroney heard the contents of this missive
with a grave countenance. Then, looking at his wife’s
charming face, all irradiated between the joys of her
good conscience and its unexpected reward, he exclaimed
generously that it was a proud day for the House of
O’Hara. “Though,” he added, “the proudest moment
of it all was when I saw you stand by your friend, me
darling girl!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In Which Miss Pamela Pounce is ordered<br>
to Pack</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pamela Pounce</span> sat with a bunch of cowslips in one
hand and the lid of the ribbon box in the other; she
had fallen into a profound muse.</p>

<p>It was the cowslips, though they were but artifice,
which had set her active brain thus suddenly and idly
day-dreaming. They had brought her back with a rush
to the old farm where she had been born and brought up.
The whole surroundings of her exile had vanished. She
was no longer in the big, bare, stuffy, untidy workroom at
the back of Madame Eglantine’s celebrated Paris hat shop:
in the centre of snippets and straws, feathers, fringes,
flowers and other fashionable fripperies; under the
glare of the skylight; with the patter and gabble of
French voices, the click of scissors, the long-drawn sighs
or quick pants of energetic stitching, the rustle of
crumpled silks, in her ears, and in her nostrils the indescribable
atmosphere of the <i>atélier</i>, as it was called.
An apartment hermetically sealed to the outer airs, save
what might penetrate of them through the opening of
its doors; redolent of the gums of artificial flowers, of
last year’s and this morning’s succulent cookery—Monsieur
Ildefonse, the husband of Madame Eglantine,
liked a point of garlic in most dishes—and of the faint
sickly scents of hair powder and fine lady’s perfumes
which hung about the whole establishment. There were
other odours in the workroom besides, of which the less
said the better. It was little wonder that Pamela Pounce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
should now and again feel her splendid vitality slacken;
that she should have considerably fined down from a
country buxomness since she had joined Madame
Eglantine’s staff.</p>

<p>But the bunch of cowslips had brought her away—far
away from it all for a blissful moment.</p>

<p>She was back again at home. The exquisite freshness
of an early summer morning on the Kentish downs encompassed
her. Her young bosom lifted with ecstasy.
Oh! the breath of England: pungent of the sea, sweet
of the moorland herbs, free from the hills and whispering
of the woods, was there ever anything like it? There
was a fragrance of breadmaking too from mother’s oven,
and a lovely reek of burning weeds where father was busy
over the potato fields!</p>

<p>Pamela started. A voice, sharp as a pen-knife, had
recalled her to reality.</p>

<p>“Ah, Meess”—she went by no other name in this
French servitude, either from her employer or her sister
workers. It was an unconscious tribute to a certain fine
apartness of character, as well as to her British independence.
“Ah, Meess,” cried Madame Eglantine, “is this
how I find you? Asleep with your eyes open! My
faith, is this how you conduct yourself in the thick of
the business hours? And the Marquise who expects
that hat by noon!”</p>

<p>Pamela opened her day-dreaming eyes full upon the
speaker, gave an inaudible sigh and a small ironic smile.
She did not start or blush or show any sign either of flurry
or vexation at the acrid accent of the rebuke, she was too
completely mistress of herself for that. Her hand
hovered over the ribbon box; then with a decisive movement
she nipped a shimmering purple roll and began to
draw out its darkly radiant lengths.</p>

<p>“Purple!” ejaculated Madame Eglantine, surprised
into a quite amiable tone; “purple for that blonde
Marquise who is not yet twenty! And she means to
wear all white muslins with lace in floods. Did I not tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
you so? That ribbon I bought for <i>Madame la Gouvernante</i>—it
is for dowagers——”</p>

<p>She broke off and stared.</p>

<p>Pamela had twisted and snipped and pinched and the
hat was trimmed in what her famous <i>patronne</i> herself
would have described as “<i>un tour de main</i>.” She now
held it up on her balled hand, and turned it slowly from
side to side.</p>

<p>“But it is a stroke of genius!” exclaimed the little
Frenchwoman. She hated Pamela, but she was above all
an artist. “No, no, do not touch it again, no one must
touch it! You have a thousand times reason. Blue or
green or pink—anyone with the ordinary mind would
have blended me the banal pretty-pretty with those
cowslips. The Marquise would have been but one of a
score of shepherdesses, no more distinguished than a
dragée box for a baptism! But now——”</p>

<p>She paused and waved her hands before the delight of
the mental picture. A small, dusky woman with very
bright eyes and extraordinarily swift movements, she
was like some quick furry animal of the mouse tribe;
a greater contrast to the fair, large, composed English
girl could hardly be imagined; yet on one point these two
were singularly akin. Both were geniuses in the same
restricted yet fascinating realm of art.</p>

<p>If there were a creature on earth capable of stepping
straight off into the shoes of Madame Eglantine, first
milliner in the world of Fashion, it was Pamela Pounce,
the British yeoman’s daughter!</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this consciousness of her rival’s merits
which made the Frenchwoman, while too acute of intellect
not to recognise them, regard her clever apprentice
with feelings which approached detestation. Yet she
was soon to find another cause.</p>

<p>“I’d better put in the stitches myself, I suppose,
M’dame?” said Pamela tranquilly. She spoke French
fluently by this time, with a pronounced if not unpleasing
British accentuation. “The young ladies are so fond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
of sewing things to death. It’s like a hand on pastry,”
she went on meditatively, as she bit her thread, and flung
a cool, tantalising glance at the irate ring of countenances
about her. “You have, or you haven’t got it, and no
one to blame.”</p>

<p>“That will do, Meess. There is too much conversation
here, Mademoiselle Panache!” Madame hopped spitefully
from Pamela upon the directress, who, sitting large,
square and sallow at the centre table, dispensing materials,
had permitted herself a gratified smile over the snubbing
of the English girl. For a moment or two there was
silence in the over-lighted, under-ventilated apartment.
The season was early July; a blazing white sunshine was
pouring down through the casements which their muffed
glass but feebly mitigated.</p>

<p>Then the little angry, sharp-toothed mouse that was
the bland, coaxing, fluent Eglantine of the showroom
found a fresh grievance.</p>

<p>“My God, Mademoiselle Anatoline, are you making
a bouquet or tying bristles on a broomstick? And
Heaven pardon me, Mademoiselle Eulalie, but if those
hands of yours have been washed since—since—— What
have you been doing with those hands, <i>ma fille</i>? Blacking
the boots or scratching your head?”</p>

<p>Anatoline, who was large and fat and fair, became an
apoplectic purple; and Eulalie, who was the colour of a
lemon with hair like a raven’s wing, turned a shade more
livid than nature had made her.</p>

<p>There was a titter, beginning sycophantically upon the
lips of Mademoiselle Panache. But Pamela’s smooth
face, white where it was not delicately carnation,
might have been that of a handsomely tinted statue.
She cut her thread, tweaked one of the shimmering
purple loops, and once again putting the hat on her
clenched hand, gave it a little shake. The creation was
complete!</p>

<p>Madame’s swift beady eye rolled in her direction.</p>

<p>“Give yourself the trouble to bring that upstairs to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
showroom, Meess,” she ordered. “Madame D’Aimargues
said she would call, herself, before midday, to try
it on before it was sent. I will join you presently and
you had better remain, in case there were required an
alteration.”</p>

<p>“<i>Bien, M’dame</i>,” Pamela responded with some alacrity.
She might get a whiff of good open air as she went up the
stairs. There might even be a window ajar in the showroom.
Such a miracle had been known to occur on a
very hot day.</p>

<p>Monsieur Ildefonse, Eglantine’s husband, was sitting
in the little glass cage off the back showroom, pompously
referred to as the <i>Bureau</i>. This individual had once
been a very noted personality; no other, actually, than
the French Queen’s appointed coiffeur; in consequence
sought after to frenzy by every woman with the smallest
pretension to Fashion. Fine ladies had had their heads
dressed at six o’clock in the morning, nay, even three
days before some special assembly at Court.</p>

<p>To be able to say, with a toss of flying vaporous curls,
exquisitely redolent of <i>Poudre à la Maréchale</i>: “In
effect, my dear one, Ildefonse’s last idea, what do you
think of it? It is succeeded. <i>Hein?</i>” To be responded
to, perchance, with a cry of envy and despair: “Ildefonse!
You managed to get Ildefonse!” And to know your
interlocutor, younger than you perhaps, and prettier,
yet altogether at a disadvantage, “a positive frump,
my dear,” under less skilful hands, that had been to reach,
in verity, the very needle-peak of feminine triumph, a
few years ago.</p>

<p>But star succeeds to star; one Monsieur Charles was
Court twiddler, curler, crimper, frizzer, and general head
artist. For Monsieur Ildefonse had come into a heritage
and retired. Not a fallen star, therefore; merely astronomically
removed to another hemisphere! He shone
now, though, it may be added, with a doubtful radiance,
in a restricted connubial circle; in other words, he sat at
home and totted up accounts for his clever, money-making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
spouse; made bargains for her with flower
manufacturers and mercers, and bullied the stewards
of great houses when Madame la Duchesse or Madame
la Connétable forgot to remember such insignificances
as the settlement of bills.</p>

<p>Unanimously the workgirls adored him, with the
single exception of Pamela; and the relations between
Madame Eglantine and her consort, characterised in
public by the most touching demonstrativeness, were
regarded as the very romance of matrimony. But
Pamela, who had come under the glance, more often than
she cared, of Monsieur Ildefonse’s slyly roving eye, had
her private opinion.</p>

<p>She shuddered from him as she had shuddered from the
fat, sleek, brown slugs that came out after rain on the
garden walls at home.</p>

<p>As a little girl she would explain: “’Tain’t that I’m
afraid, you see, but it makes me creep.”</p>

<p>She could have found no better words in which to describe
the effect upon her of the fascinating Monsieur Ildefonse.</p>

<p>There was a midday lull, this scorching day, even in
Madame Eglantine’s thriving establishment. It was
late season, too, and save for orders like that of the little
Marquise D’Aimargues, for such as were privileged to
join in the pastimes of Royal haymaking and churning,
or a stray wedding order, business was slack, and the
great little milliner herself was preparing for that round
of the most noted watering places, with “just a few
models” in her baggage, which was her thrifty fashion
of spending the holidays.</p>

<p>Pamela cast, in passing, a hasty glance between the
green curtains of the <i>Bureau</i>, to assure herself that her
pet aversion was safely employed.</p>

<p>He had removed his wig on account of the heat, and
she turned her eyes quickly away from the revolting
spectacle of his close-cropped bristling black head and
the roll of olive fat at the back of his neck above the
embroidered collar of his blue cloth coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>The pink, be-padded, be-wreathed, be-gilded, be-mirrored,
be-draped salons of Madame Eglantine were
empty. Pamela walked slowly into the middle of the
front room and hesitated. Her own charming shape
was reflected from every possible angle. Down below,
the whole <i>Place</i> seemed asleep; a buzz of flies within
and without, a lazy footfall on the shady side and a
distant rumble emphasised the universal drowsiness.</p>

<p>When Madame la Marquise’s coach came along there
would be a prodigious clatter to wake them all up.
Pamela knew that she was quite safe. It’s all very well
to trim a hat. You never know what it’s like till you’ve
tried it on.</p>

<p>Very deliberately she divested her glossy chestnut hair
of its discreet cap, loosened the swelling waves a trifle
more on either side of the firm rose-tinted ivory of her
face.</p>

<p>“If a dash of powder was for poor girls like me, I
wouldn’t be too bad-looking. I’d say that for myself,”
she thought, and firmly set the hat of the Marquise at
the right angle over her radiant brow.</p>

<p>Well, it was a complete success. Like every true
artist she was doubly critical of herself, but Pamela had
to admit that she could find no flaw in her own taste
and that the wide-brimmed curving Italian straw with its
bold sweep of purple ribbon, and its hanging bunches of
cowslips was a remarkably fine set-off for the glory of her
amber hair and the audacious brilliance of her complexion.
Without a tinge of envy or discontent she surveyed herself
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Pamela Pounce, my girl!”—she
was fond of addressing herself mentally; as it were her
strong reasonable mind to her agreeable body. “You
would have held your own with the best of them if it had
been the fancy of Providence to set you in the aristocracy.
Ugh!”</p>

<p>With a piercing scream she started out of her complacent
reflection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>A horrible olive-hued, leering face appeared over her
shoulder in the mirror; a blue-clothed arm stole round
her waist.</p>

<p>Pamela swung herself free, whisked the hat off her
head ready to use it as a weapon should Monsieur Ildefonse
pursue his advances.</p>

<p>In the dead pause the quick rustle of Madame Eglantine’s
light summer flounces were heard on the stairs.</p>

<p>Instantly the ex-hairdresser’s countenance lost its
satyr smiles, and became composed into its usual mask of
smooth propriety.</p>

<p>“Is that you, <i>mon Agneau rose</i>?” he cooed.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, it is I, <i>petit rat de mon cœur</i>,” she replied.</p>

<p>These endearments having perfunctorily passed between
them, Madame halted on the threshold and sent the
glitter of her swift glance from her spouse to her apprentice.</p>

<p>“I took the liberty of trying on the hat what I’ve just
trimmed, M’dame,” said Pamela then in her brazen way.</p>

<p>She wasn’t going to put it into Monsieur Ildefonse’s
power to tell on her behind her back, or worse still, to
pretend to be shielding her. She knew his slimy ways.</p>

<p>“You do well to call it a liberty,” said Madame Ildefonse,
showing all her small pointed teeth as if she wanted
to bite Pamela. She was panting a little, and there was
a sort of whiteness about her nostrils that pointed to
considerable if repressed emotion. “But let it pass.
You were giving your opinion, I presume, my cabbage-stalk?”</p>

<p>“Meess very naturally wished me to admire your
exquisite taste, <i>ma tendre biche</i>,” he responded. “‘No
one,’ says she to me, ‘but Madame Eglantine could have
made this inimitable, this absolutely original and distinguished
combination, all the while retaining the stamp
of the most high tone.’”</p>

<p>Monsieur Ildefonse was very glib of tongue.</p>

<p>“A-ah!” said Madame, smiling horribly. “You and
Meess flatter me in your private conversations.”</p>

<p>“My charmer, how can I console myself in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
absence, except by——” he broke off, for at that moment,
with sounds of pomp, a thunder of hoofs, a crash and a
clatter, the street woke up indeed, as Miss Pounce had
prognosticated. And Madame D’Aimargues drove up
in her four-horsed coach.</p>

<p>Madame Eglantine cast off her rage, as one may divest
oneself of a garment, to be re-assumed at the chosen
moment; Monsieur Ildefonse, with a relieved shrug of
his huge shoulders, began to retire, cat-footed, to his den.</p>

<p>“Remain as you are, Meess,” commanded the milliner,
now entirely concentrated on the exigencies of her
business.</p>

<p>She shook out her flounces and summoning the bland
business smile to her features cast a swift glance at the
nearest mirror before taking two steps to greet her
valuable patroness.</p>

<p>It was that glance at the mirror which precipitated
the catastrophe. By some counter-reflection, Madame
Eglantine’s jealous eyes caught a vision of Ildefonse,
her husband, her cabbage, the little rat of her heart,
pausing in his turn to cast a final ogle upon the abandoned,
the sly, the seductive, the shameless Meess!</p>

<p>Eglantine beheld that ogle. She swallowed her
emotion. She was above all <i>femme d’affaires</i>. Everything
must give way before the profit of the moment.
She could wait.</p>

<p>The little Marquise, blonde and slim and rouged,
ethereal yet vivid, fluttered in, fanning herself, tried on
her hat, chattered, laughed, approved, exclaimed upon
the heat, and, still fanning herself, departed, leaving on
Pamela’s mind the impression of a glittering butterfly,
as lovely, as useless, and as impalpable. You could
crush her, thought the girl, between finger and thumb.</p>

<p>Her serious lambent gaze had hardly followed the
radiant apparition to the door, when the explosion burst
forth.</p>

<p>It was all the more devastating for having been withheld.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>Wanton! Hussy! Baggage! Designing intriguing
slut! <i>Meess de Malheur!</i> What was Pamela, after all,
but a stray apprentice, and an English one at that, flung
upon her, Madame Eglantine’s, benevolence for the sake
of old friendship, living on charity, a <i>beggar</i>! <i>Cette
Lydie</i>, how she had haggled! But if such wickedness
had been paid for in all the gold of false Albion, Madame
Eglantine would not have kept her, to the destruction of
her domestic happiness!</p>

<p>“Meess, you pack this day.”</p>

<p>She further added a flood of vituperation, to which
Pamela, all her pretty carnations dead on her white
cheeks, listened in a fixed silence.</p>

<p>When the Frenchwoman had run herself out of breath
on a high scream, Pamela answered her in English, which
the whilom Bath milliner spoke brokenly, but understood
perfectly. “That’ll do, M’dame. I’m as pleased
to get out of this place as ever you can be to see the
back of me. As for that fat husband of yours, I wouldn’t
touch him with a pair of tongs. And as for yourself,
I’d not remain a moment longer than I can help with one
as doesn’t know the meaning of truth, and would take
an honest girl’s character away out of pure spite and
malice. And don’t you dare,” pursued Pamela, with a
swelling voice, “say anything against my character, or
as sure as there is justice in Heaven, I’ll bring your
business about your ears. I’ll tell that old cat, my
Aunt Lydia, what’s happened, that you caught your
horrid old Ildefonse ogling me in the glass, and that you
haven’t that trust in him—and sure, I’m with you there,
for he ain’t fit to be trusted the length of your apron, and
so I tell you fair—you haven’t that trust in him that
you could have another moment of peace with me under
your roof. God help you; I don’t blame you! Give
me the price of my ticket home, and I’ll see Aunt don’t
get at you over the indenture.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>For all her courage, for all the longing which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
thought of England brought her, the heart of Pamela
Pounce was heavy as lead. She knew that, at the
Kentish farm, things were going badly with the yeoman;
she knew that she dared not add the burden of her penniless
self to that which rested on his shoulders. She
knew that odious as it would be, that abominably as her
relative would abuse of the situation, there would be
nothing for it, but to throw herself again on her Aunt
Lydia’s family feeling, as soon as the Dover coach landed
her in London town.</p>

<p>Her aunt was now with her mistress in Hertford Street,
back from the Wells, according to the latest reports, and
that was one bit of luck; another was, that judging by
the tone of the letter just received by Madame Eglantine
with an order for hats, my Lady Kilcroney’s maid was in
the highest exultation over her mistress’s royal promotion.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In which Miss Pamela Pounce, the Milliner’s Assistant,<br>
becomes Arbiter of Life and Death in High<br>
Society</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Pray Mrs. Tabbishaw</i>,” wrote my Lady Kilcroney’s
woman to the Mantua maker in Cheapside, “<i>send
Pamela along with those white feathers of her ladyship’s,
which you has, this ever so long, to be died blew, yours
obleeged</i>,</p>

<p class="right">“<i>Lydia Pounce</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> the fact of Pamela being Lydia’s niece did not
endear her to that maturing damsel, “which,” she was
fond of remarking to any beholding them together, “do
seem prodigious absurd, seeing as how there’s scarce a
year or two betwixt us.”</p>

<p>But if Miss Lydia was not fond of displaying herself
in public with a fine strapping young woman of twenty-three
who had an inconsiderate way of dropping out
“Aunt” at every second word (“which, reely, my dear,
I vow she does a’ purpose”—and perhaps indeed she
did), my Lady Kilcroney’s indispensable Abigail, as she
never omitted informing all and sundry, had a remarkable
sense of family feeling. She had placed the inconvenient
niece with the matchless Eglantine. With such
a start in life she considered the girl’s fortune made; and
if Paris were to become the stable abode of so much
bloom and bumptiousness, she, for one, would continue
to bear the separation with fortitude.</p>

<p>When, after two or three years’ absence, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Pamela reappeared on the scene, extraordinarily Frenchified,
unconscionably beautified, and quite unpardonably
wideawake, having quarrelled to the death with Madame
Eglantine, and possessing, to boot, only the clothes on her
back and the price of her ticket, Miss Lydia Pounce was
very justly annoyed. It was quite impossible to send
the girl home, since bankruptcy threatened the Kentish
farm. Once again Lydia’s fine conception of family
obligation came to the fore. There was Mrs. Tabbishaw,
at whose second-rate establishment in Cheapside the
elder Miss Pounce had been in the habit of having such
odd jobs done for her ladyship as the dyeing and re-curling
of feathers, the cleaning and mending of unimportant
laces, the quilting of winter petticoats. Mrs. Tabbishaw
owed her a good turn, and if she would now make room
for Pamela, give her board and just enough wage for her
clothes, Lydia would see to it that her mistress should
go as far as to purchase an occasional hat.</p>

<p>Pamela had no choice but to fall in with her aunt’s
arrangements, for had not Madame Eglantine sworn that
she would give her no character? (As if, indeed, it had
been her fault that that odious Monsieur Ildefonse should
take to ogling her behind Madame’s back, and her
staring into the mirror!) She knew very well, however,
that she was sadly wasted at the poor, unmodish place;
and, indeed, since Mrs. Tabbishaw was too stupid to
realise the treasure that had come her way, the younger
Miss Pounce was forthwith turned into a maid-of-all-work.
Her long, clever fingers were set to scrub and
to cook, to pink or to quilt, or to whatever odd job
pressed the most. She was kept running to and fro with
parcels, and up and downstairs on messages. She was
sent galloping to shops and warehouses to match ribbons
and velvets, and all the while the wives and daughters of
the city went on purchasing the modes of the year before
last, as interpreted by vulgar minds, while spirit, delicacy,
art, dash, millinery genius in fine, was actually within
their reach! Not that Pamela Pounce had any desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
to adorn them. Her aspirations flew very high. Some
day she meant to be as great in her line as Eglantine
herself, to exercise her talents upon heads as worth while
as my Lady Kilcroney’s own.</p>

<p>“You’re jealous of me, you cat!” It was thus she
apostrophised the worthy Aunt Lydia in the solitude of
her bare attic chamber. “You’re jealous of me. You
know you’re an old maid and peevish, and I’m only
twenty-three and better-looking than you ever were in
your life, with twice your wits, though yours are as sharp
as your elbows. You think I’d take the shine out of you,
you lemon-faced thing! You know I’d toss up a bit of
lace and feather for your ladyship’s boudoir cap, and that
her ladyship would nigh faint with the ecstasy of it when
she saw herself in the glass. And a sweet pretty creature
she is—the one glimpse I ever had of her, and that through
the door, you mean thing! Ah, give me a chance, and I
swear the sedans and the carriages would be blocking the
streets to get at me. But not if you can help it, old Miss
Pounce! You’re to be the only important Miss Pounce
in this world; that’s your little game! But ’tis not for
nothing I’ve got it all in me!”</p>

<p>And hugging her knees as she sat on her bed—the chair
being too rickety to bear her fine proportions—Miss
Pounce the younger would map out her future in glorious
processions of feathers and head-dresses, hats and bonnets,
wreaths and <i>négligés</i>.</p>

<p>Through all the hardships, the dreary daily grind, the
unkindness and the unremitting exertions, her star shone
upon her with a light that never wavered. The first
winter was a trying one, and Pamela found London,
after Paris, a cruel, ugly place; a cruel cold one, and a
cruel hard one. When the summer came, existence
might be easier, but the hours were longer with the daylight,
and there were nights when even Pamela’s high
heart gave way, and she would drop on her pallet bed
almost too exhausted to sleep. She had grown thin, and
there was a certain fierceness in the fire of her bright grey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
eyes, as if they looked on all humanity as an enemy, by
that July 16th, 1789, when my Lady Kilcroney’s woman
wrote for the “blew feathers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, drat!” said Mrs. Tabbishaw.</p>

<p>She was just sitting down to her dinner at three o’clock
in the afternoon of a torrid day. The reek of roast duck
and sage and onions was succulently in the air, and there
was a tankard of porter facing and winking amber bubbles
beside her plate already.</p>

<p>“Drat!” Mrs. Tabbishaw took a gulp of the porter,
and waddled to the door to scream: “Those blue
feathers, where the deuce were they put? Pamela!
Pamela! I say, where is that girl? My chest is wore
out screeching for her. Where’s Pamela, Miss Trotter,
dear?”</p>

<p>“Just a-setting down to bread-and-cheese in the
scullery,” screamed a thin voice from the counting-house.</p>

<p>“Setting down! It’s like her impidence! Send for
her this moment, Miss Trotter. Tell her she’s got to take
my Lady Kilcroney’s blue feathers to Hertford Street
this very minute. Tell her it’s pressing, Miss Trotter.
And stay, look out my lady’s bill, which Miss Pounce
promised me to have settled this while back, and it
twelve pound odd. Tell the chit to ask her aunt for it.
I’m none too fond of letting fine ladies’ bills run up, and
it all for odds and ends that are scarce worth my doing.
And, hark ye, tell her she’ll have to hurry back too, with
that pinking to finish to-night for Mrs. Alderman Gruntle’s
cradle, and her eleventh due any time.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“For mercy’s sake, Aunt Lydia,” said Pamela Pounce,
as much to that damsel’s surprise and annoyance she was
ushered in upon her by Pompey, the black page. “Give
me a bit of bread-and-butter, and a drink of Bohea, for
I declare to Heaven I’m starving. And I’ve brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
you the feathers. And they’re dyed a dreadful blue, I
think; but once you give anything over to Mrs. Tabbishaw
you get the mark of her paw upon it, and so I tell
you.”</p>

<p>“’Twould be well if she put the mark of her paw
upon you, miss, for your impidence. Bread-and-butter,
quotha! And I’m sure ’tis a good thing if you are a
trifle fined down from the gross size you was when you
came back from Paris. ‘Dear me,’ says my lord’s new
man to me, when he caught sight of you, ‘that’s a prize
one! She’d make ten of you,’ he says; and him so
genteel, I blushed to hear him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that fellow!” Pounce the younger tossed her
head; “waylaying me on the stairs to say I couldn’t be
a Pounce, being so—well, so vastly different from you,
Aunt Lydia. And begging to see me home; as if I’d
let him—a valet, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Upon my word!” Lydia’s faded, sallow, pretty
countenance went a trifle more sallow, and looked considerably
less pretty. “Who’s to talk of impidence, I’d
like to know, and what do you expect, miss?”</p>

<p>“Somebody considerably less like stripes and buttons.
If I don’t get a gentleman one day, Aunt——”</p>

<p>“A gentleman? La, hear her!”</p>

<p>“I’ll go single, like yourself.”</p>

<p>Pamela’s full light grey eyes became abstracted. Anon,
as she had turned in at the area railings, a young gentleman
had dashed by her up the steps, and had set the
knocker thundering against the panels of the hall door.
As she had looked up he had looked down at her; and
then he had smiled, and made a little gesture towards his
hat, which if not the courtesy he would have paid to
one of his own class, was nevertheless a genial, pleasant
salute. She thought she had never seen so handsome
a countenance; come under the gaze of such
flashing dark eyes. There would be a lad for one
who was lucky enough to be able to go in at the front
door!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“And, indeed, miss——”</p>

<p>Lydia wheeled round, and perceiving Pompey lingering,
all one grin, tweaked his wool.</p>

<p>“How dare you, you little blackamore! What are
you doing here?”</p>

<p>“He’s waiting for orders to get me a cup of chocolate
and a bit of cake, aren’t you, Pompey?” cried the quite
audacious Pamela. “I’m sure my Lady’ll never miss it.
And as soon as I’ve got it to give, I’ll give you a crown-piece,
Pompey.”</p>

<p>She laughed on the little boy, and when Pamela Pounce
laughed, she was something to look on; for her wide,
fresh mouth curled so deliciously, and the corners of it
went up so gaily, and she had such fine, white, even
teeth, and as the dimples came and went, she gained
such adorable little lines of fun about half-shut eyes,
and the most engaging little crinkle in her cocked
nose!</p>

<p>“La!” Mrs. Tabbishaw’s slavey cast herself into her
aunt’s arm-chair, untied the ribbons of her wide straw
hat, and flung it on the table. She ran her long fingers,
surprisingly white in spite of their toil, through the
roughened curls of her chestnut hair, stretched her long
legs luxuriously, and contemplating the dust on her
shabby shoes: “Thought I should have dropped, I did,”
she cried, “when I come into Shepherd’s Market—three
big feathers and two little ones, Aunt Lydia!
And, la! the blue! ’Tis the peacockest vile colour, I
ever—— And oh, here’s my Lady’s bill! And old Tabby
must have it paid. She’s all swears and spits and fur-flying
about it, as it is. ‘Get your aunt to pay,’ she says,
‘for her beggarly odds and ends that don’t bring an
honest body a bit of worth while,’ and oh!” she
yawned outrageously, “I’m to hurry back, no less,
for Mrs. Alderman Gruntle’s eleventh is waiting on my
pinking.”</p>

<p>“My lady’s account!” Lydia snatched the written
sheet from her niece’s hand: “Of all the—there, that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
what comes o’ dealing with them second-class shops.
Mrs. Tabbishaw thinks my Lady can be treated like one
of her City bodies, I declare.”</p>

<p>“I’m not to go back without the money,” said
Pamela.</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure! And my Lady so put about as
never! What with her new hat being such a failure, and
her out of sorts too, over her gown for the Birthday,
she about to take up her first turn as Lady-in-Waiting
into the bargain—Court friends being that spiteful, and
my Lord having the ill luck at Whites, and Bellairs’ young
nephew, Mr. Jocelyn, an audacious, gaming, young
rascal, if ever I see one, as set on the dice as my Lord,
and him but a beggar, so to speak. And my Lady paying
his passage back to India twice over, to my certain
knowledge, and him losing it on the green cloth within
the hour! Well, my Lady’s done with him, that’s one
good thing. ’Tain’t the moment for Tabbishaw, and
so I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Why, la!” Pamela had a graceful, lazy mockery
in her eye and voice which, however ill-placed in one of
her humble station, somehow became her. “My Lord
must have been, indeed, uncommon out of luck, if my
Lady Kilcroney, her as every one knows is a-rolling in
old Bellairs’ money, can’t pay twelve sovereigns to a poor
shop in the City. But give me back the bill, Aunt, and
I’ll tell Mrs. Tabbishaw she’s got to wait till my Lord
casts a better tot.”</p>

<p>Lady Kilcroney’s maid gazed at her audacious relative
as if deprived of speech. Nevertheless, in all her wrath
there was a certain grudging admiration.</p>

<p>“The girl’s as insolent as if she’d been born a
lady!”</p>

<p>The thought flashed across her mind as she whisked
through the door brandishing the account. On the
threshold the power of language returned to her.</p>

<p>“As if twelve sovereigns wasn’t as many farthings to
one of my Lady’s wealth!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Here she nearly cannoned against Pompey with a tray,
and bidding him wait to be dealt with till his hands were
empty of chocolate, disappeared, objurgating, down the
passage.</p>

<p>Pamela was half-way through her second cup of chocolate,
vastly refreshed and comforted by it, and the agreeable
little cakes which had accompanied it, when her
relative returned, with a red spot on either cheek bone,
her nostrils dilated over panting breaths. She had all
the air of one who emerges from a wrestle. The light of
battle, was still in her eye, but of battle victorious.</p>

<p>“Here, miss,” she cried, “thirteen sovereigns to settle
your Tabbishaw, and milady says you can keep the
change. Gave me all sorts, she did, being, as who should
know better than I, from early morning, my dear, in as
peevish a temper as ever was. And—and what she can
do in that way,” said Lydia, turning up her eyes,
“you’d never believe if you hadn’t seen, the world
being made up of Diddumses. There wasn’t an item along
here she didn’t have her scratch at, and in the end, she
says: ‘For Heaven’s sake stop talking!’ (That’s how
poor servants is treated).</p>

<p>“‘You’ll have me reeling in the head,’ she says.
‘Take thirteen sovereigns from my purse, and get out of
my room and don’t let me hear another word of that there
maddening bill!’ And so you can keep the change, my
love. And, if you’d believe it, just out of cussedness, the
young gentleman what’s annoyed her so prodigious has
the boldness to come knocking at our hall door and
demanding urgent, through Mr. Blandfoot, the butler,
a few moments’ conversation with her ladyship. My Lady
having given orders that he was not to be admitted,
the scamp sends for the butler—well, that’s about dished
him, I can tell you!</p>

<p>“‘Tell him, Blandfoot,’ says my lady, ‘that I don’t
give alms at the door. Tell him,’ she says, ‘to go and
earn his living. I don’t hold,’ she says, ‘with able-bodied
beggars!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Oh,” said Pamela, her thoughts flying back with
compassion to the dashing young gentleman on the
doorstep, “what a cruel thing to say. ’Tis insulting
misfortune.”</p>

<p>“Insulting fiddlesticks! Here, hasten, you baggage,
or you’ll lose your good place, and I’ve had enough of you
for one day, I can tell you that.”</p>

<p>“And what a darling, sweet auntie you are!” said the
second Miss Pounce, as she tied on her shepherdess hat
with knowing little peeps at the mirror. “’Tain’t any
wonder I love you. Ta-ta.”</p>

<p>She dropped the sovereigns into her worn reticule,
kissed her hand from the door in sarcastic farewell, and
departed.</p>

<p>With fourteen shillings and twopence to the good in her
pocket, Pamela felt a singular sense of independence.
Instead of hurrying back into the heat, crowd, and toil of
Cheapside, she turned her steps towards Hyde Park, the
green boughs of which seemed to beckon to her from the
top of the street.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and sit under the trees,” thought the girl.
“An idea for a hat has come into my mind, and I’ll work
it out and let Mrs. Alderman Gruntle and her cradle and
the pinking go to the deuce.”</p>

<p>She found a retired spot in the shade, and, the turf
being dry and inviting, stretched herself luxuriously at
full length to stare upwards at the odd little triangles and
stars of blue sky visible through the interlacing leaves
above her.</p>

<p>Composing her hat with the zest of a poet his verses,
she lay at ease, in great content, when she was startled
by the sound of rapid footsteps on the sward.</p>

<p>She sat up and beheld a young man, a very fine and
modish-looking young gentleman indeed, who advanced
with great strides, brought himself to a sudden halt
within the shady little dell, and casting swift looks from
side to side, as if to make sure he was not observed, flung
his hat on the ground and stood staring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>Pamela, shielded from observation by a clump of bushes,
watched with a sudden and inexplicable feeling of apprehension,
which grew as she caught sight of a drawn
countenance, deathly pale.</p>

<p>“For sure,” thought she, “the poor gentleman’s
desperate!”</p>

<p>The next instant she sprang to her feet with a scream;
he had drawn a pistol from his breast pocket and, with
an odd jerk, almost as if forced by some malevolent
power which he could not withstand, raised it to his
temple.</p>

<p>Pamela was one of those rare beings in whom swift wits
unite with swift action. She hurled herself upon the
would-be suicide and wrenched the weapon from his
hand. For a strange moment they stood facing each
other, eye into eye. It seemed to her as if the whole
world held nothing but those mad eyes of his, dilated,
starting, haunted; the pupils were contracting and expanding
in the violet irises as with some dreadful
pulse of his heart. Suddenly his whole being relaxed;
he smiled.</p>

<p>“Good heavens,” she cried, “’tis the young gentleman
on the doorstep!”</p>

<p>“And you,” said he, “are the young lady in the area.
If the next world’s as odd as this, ’twill be a vastly comic
place.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Pamela, who did not at all like this
reference to Eternity. Still less did she like the manner
in which he put out his hand towards the pistol.</p>

<p>“By your leave, my dear. My property, I believe?”</p>

<p>She strove to avoid his grasp; she fought to keep the
weapon in her hand. “Why, what farce is this?” he
exclaimed, laughing. “What do you imagine, my good
girl? May not an actor practise his greatest scene
without——? Why, what prodigious nonsense have
you got into your pretty head? The things’s not even
loaded!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but what did you say yourself just now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>She was a vigorous creature, and terror lent her
strength. She remained in possession of the dangerous
implement.</p>

<p>“What did I say? I merely tried the effect of my
most telling speech upon you—with fine result. If my
public are as impressionable——”</p>

<p>Once more he stretched out his hand, but, leaping from
him, the girl raised the pistol, aimed at the nearest bush,
pulled the trigger, and fired.</p>

<p>As the reverberations died away she turned a face,
drained of colour but triumphant, upon him.</p>

<p>“So much for your story, Mr. Actor!” cried
she.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re too quick for me!” he answered, with
a moody change, thrust his hands into his pockets, began
to pace the dell backwards and forwards before her,
kicking his hat each time he passed it.</p>

<p>She thought that he was no more than a boy, for all his
manly growth, and her heart went out to him.</p>

<p>“Here, give me the pistol,” he said. “Tush, child,
’tis safe enough for the moment. We’ll be having the
park-keeper upon us to see who’s been murdered. Let
us look innocent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh,” she shuddered, “if I had not been
there!”</p>

<p>“Nay, my dear, I’m in no mood to thank you, I protest.
Yet ’tis something to have had a vision of a pretty
face and a kind, womanly spirit at the last.”</p>

<p>“There you go again! Sir, sir!”</p>

<p>She surrendered the smoking pistol, and, as he slipped
it into his pocket:</p>

<p>“Farewell, my dear,” said he.</p>

<p>“Ah, no!” She clutched his arm by both hands.
“You shall not go till you have promised me—promised
me on your honour as a gentleman to spare
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I could do that, on my honour,” he answered her;
“but that I will not quibble before such true eyes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Nevertheless it is to spare myself that I seek death. You
bid me on my honour. ’Tis because I cannot live dishonoured
that I hold this pistol to my temples. ’Tis not
that I don’t love life as well as another man, or better.
’Fore Heaven, it is because I have loved life too well. Had
I as much as a guinea in my pocket I would have defied
Fate. When I stood on those steps and rapped that
knocker a while ago, I swear I had as little thought of
blowing my brains out as you had. When you and I
smiled at each other I thought this world a very good
place, I do assure you. That woman in her fine house
yonder, rolling in luxury, with her lap dog and her
chocolate and her black page, her jewels and her laces,
her silks and her satins; all in her cushions; that woman,
I say, who finds the Bellairs’ money of so vast a use to
spend, might have given me a ten-pound note out of her
store. When all’s said and done, I’m the only Bellairs
left. And, if but a nephew by marriage, nevertheless
the last kin of her old Nabob. Ten pounds I asked of her—that
contemptible sum! And what did I receive?
The vilest insult, through the most insulting medium.
Odds my life, when I think of it——”</p>

<p>He clenched his hands.</p>

<p>Pamela stood, reflecting profoundly, one needle-marked
finger to her lip, her white brow drawn together under
the shade of her hat.</p>

<p>Ten pounds to save a man’s honour. It seemed indeed
a strangely small sum! As if he read her thought, he
broke forth:</p>

<p>“I dreamt last night, three times over, that I tossed a
double six at tric-trac, and ’tis the sixteenth of July and
I am twenty-six. My Lord Sanquhar promised to give
me my revenge at the Six Bells at six of the clock. ’Twas
such a conjunction of luck as could not fail. I would have
won back my I.O.U.’s. I would have returned my Lady
Kilcroney the passage money to India. She wants to
ship me to India, my dear, the inconvenient poor relation.
Ah, she need not fear. I shall beg from her no more.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
What a farce it has all been! ’Tis time to put an end
to it. Bless you for your sweet looks, my pretty child.
Think of me only as one who, after life’s fitful fever,
sleeps well. Aha! I shall sleep better I dare say, than
my Lady Kilcroney when she has read the letter I sent
to her anon!”</p>

<p>“One moment, Mr. Bellairs, since that’s your name,”
said Pamela Pounce, with her wide, lovely smile. She
dived into her reticule, and began to gather the coins
together with counting digits. “If you’ll condescend to
borrow of a person who goes in by the area gates, here are
thirteen sovereigns at your service. I’ve just had a long
bill paid me. And, oh,” cried Pamela, suddenly and
unexpectedly bursting into tears, “I wish they were
three hundred!”</p>

<p>“Gracious heavens!” said the young gentleman.</p>

<p>“If you don’t take them I’ll never know another
happy moment,” sobbed Pamela. “Oh, how could
I? Oh, sir, don’t say ‘No,’ because I am just a poor
girl.”</p>

<p>“Nay then. I won’t say ‘No.’ Upon my soul, I don’t
care if you go in at the coal hole, you’ve the finest spirit
and the prettiest face, ay, and the warmest heart I’ve
ever met in woman.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand, and she put the money into it.
He hesitated then, and looked at her; and perhaps
because of some warning that flashed through her wet
eyes, or perhaps because of some innate spring of good
breeding in him, he only kissed the hand that had been
strong to save him.</p>

<p>“Pray, what o’clock is it?” He struck his waistcoat,
where a black ribbon made pretence for a missing watch.
“My time piece has gone the way of most of my possessions.”</p>

<p>“’Tis past five,” she said, “by the shadows.”</p>

<p>The country girl had not forgotten her lore.</p>

<p>“Past five,” cried he, “and I due at the Six Bells!
If you will move a step, my dear, I will pick up my hat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Allow me, sir,” said she. “Hats are my business.”</p>

<p>She lifted the felt from the grass, dusted it with her
arm, pushed out the dent where he had kicked it, and
gave each corner a perfectly unnecessary twist.</p>

<p>“I’m in the millinery,” said she, as she handed it
to him.</p>

<p>“I thought there was something remarkably elegant
about your headgear,” he observed. “And pray oblige
me with your address, that I may know where to return
my loan, for the conviction grows in me that I am destined
to win and to live.”</p>

<p>She knew that sense of victory; it was akin to the conviction
of her own confident soul; but while she smiled
she pondered. Then she said demurely:</p>

<p>“My name is Pamela Pounce, sir. If you will
inquire for me, care of my aunt, Miss Lydia Pounce,
own woman to my Lady Kilcroney, ’twill be the safest
address.”</p>

<p>He gave her a quaint look, bowed profoundly, and
hurried away.</p>

<p>“The safest address,” he murmured, as he went. “Ah,
Pamela, you’re one of the wise virgins!”</p>

<p>Then he laughed.</p>

<p>“Farce did I call it? And I set for the blackest
tragedy! Nay, ’tis a mighty delicate comedy, and we’re
but at the first act of it.”</p>

<p>Pamela stood gazing after the retreating figure.</p>

<p>“Now,” said she to herself, “I have the choice of three
roads. I must go—to Bridewell, to the river, or to Aunt
Lydia. It had better be to Aunt Lydia.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Stripes and buttons,” who had not forgotten how the
younger Miss Pounce had snubbed him on their first
meeting, informed her that she might “hunt up the old
girl for herself”; her ladyship having gone out her ladyship’s
woman, if not in her own apartment, might be
found in her ladyship’s chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>And here indeed, with a not altogether comfortably
beating heart, Pamela confronted her aunt.</p>

<p>Lydia stared, as if beholding a ghost.</p>

<p>“La, whatever’s to do?”</p>

<p>“The money’s gone,” said Pamela with great firmness.</p>

<p>She had made up her mind from the first that nothing
should induce her to betray either the unfortunate
young gentleman or her own rash interference with his
concerns.</p>

<p>“Gone? Gone, miss?”</p>

<p>Pamela opened her reticule and mutely took out from
it a vinaigrette, three pennies, a sixpence, and a pocket
handkerchief, and showed the remaining vacuum to
Lydia’s horrified eyes.</p>

<p>“But how in the name of goodness could such a thing
happen?”</p>

<p>“You lend me the money, aunt, and I’ll pay you back
faithful, and I’ll trim you all your hats for three years
for nothing into the bargain.”</p>

<p>But with an action of little bony hands which typified
her patronymic, Miss Pounce seized the reticule from her
niece. She shook it, and tested it; she held it up to the
light, she pulled its lining out. Then she tried the clasp,
which fastened with a snap as uncompromising as that
which now closed her own tight jaws.</p>

<p>Still, without speaking, she looked volumes at the
milliner’s assistant.</p>

<p>“I declare as I’m a living woman, aunt,” asseverated
the sinner, “that I have no more notion what’s become
of the gold than you have yourself. And all I can tell
you is”—her courage rose with the sense of this perfect
adherence to the truth—“that as I left this house it
was jingling in that bag, and when last I looked there
wasn’t one left. And if you don’t come to my aid—why,
you know what Madame Tabbishaw is? She’ll
always say I stole them. Come, you’ll lend me the
money, I know you will, for father’s sake, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
name’s sake. We Pounces ain’t never been called
thieves, aunt.”</p>

<p>Her voice shook, for suddenly the word stung her,
unrepentant though she remained.</p>

<p>“Lend you!” Miss Lydia let herself fall into my
lady’s own rosy-cushioned chair and broke into piercing
remonstrance.</p>

<p>How in the name of goodness was she to find such a
sum? Did Pamela think she was made of gold? Here
was a return for all her kindness! A girl who was so
wickedly careless—likely to keep her promises, indeed!
She that ought to be racking her brains to pay back her
dear auntie for all her sacrifices.</p>

<p>“Thirty pounds, miss, it cost me to send you to Paris,
and you to be so unprincipled as to let Madame Eglantine’s
husband take to ogling you. And it’s paying me
back you ought to be, instead of having the brazenness
to ask me for thirteen pounds. And indeed, miss, it’s not
thirteen pounds I’ll give you; no, not a farthing more
than the sum of the bill. You that might have had
fourteen and tuppence!”</p>

<p>She suddenly broke off, sat up straight, and pointed a
finger at her niece with a sharp throw.</p>

<p>“Where did you go to, miss, when you left this
house? Straight, now! What? You went and sat
under the trees in the park? Upon my word, I never!
And how long might you have been a-sitting there?
You don’t know. Better and better. You went to
sleep, miss, with that there bag full of gold. Oh,
you——”</p>

<p>Pamela drooped her head, receiving the indictment
as with the humility of a guilty conscience, though she
was considerably relieved by the solution which the older
Miss Pounce had found for herself.</p>

<p>Suddenly Lydia bounced out of her seat.</p>

<p>“Mercy on us, here’s my Lady!” cried she. And then,
with a scream: “Mercy on us!” she cried again. “What
in the world has happened?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Pamela stared. My Lady Kilcroney it was indeed,
to judge by a fine feathered hat and a delicate flutter of
muslins, but a vastly different Lady Kilcroney from the
charming, happy little lady of Pamela’s remembrance.
A small figure with a stricken face crawled into the room,
and, as Lydia rushed forward, nearly swooned against
her.</p>

<p>“My Lady, my Lady, what is it?” cried the maid in
genuine concern, guiding her mistress’s form to the chair
she had herself but just vacated.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh!” moaned my Lady. “Oh, in the name
of Heaven, send for my Lord? Oh, Lydia, the letter,
the letter!”</p>

<p>Both women then saw that in a little gloved
hand my Lady Kilcroney was clutching an open
sheet. Lydia took it into her own grasp and glanced
at it.</p>

<p>“Mercy on us!” then cried she for the third time.
“That dratted young man you’ve been so good to!
Well, if ever was anything so ungrateful! To go and
put an end to himself, just to spite you! Never you take
on, my Lady, he’s no great loss, I protest. A good
riddance, say I.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh!” Kitty Kilcroney sat up and wrung her
hands. “Was ever any woman so punished for a fit of
temper? Oh, Lydia! Oh! I shall never smile again!
’Twas my Lord being so late in yestereven from White’s,
mad-stupid with his losses. And, oh, the night I had,
trying to show him the error of his ways and the vast
folly of not letting bad be when the luck’s against him.
And him going off in a huff, God knows where, before I’d
as much as swallowed my chocolate! And Mrs. Mirabel’s
hat coming on the top of it, and it is a sight to frighten
the crows after all my trouble. And my gown for Her
Majesty’s birthday the wrong yellow, and no time to get
another! And for the wretched boy to come to me then,
with his horrid tale of the dice and the cards, as bad as
my Lord’s own, him without a farthing but my bounty!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Oh, oh, ’twas true I insulted him! What’s that you say?
<i>Who are you, pray?</i>”</p>

<p>She had dropped her cries of anguish to speak with
the irritability of the afflicted.</p>

<p>“I am your woman Lydia’s niece.”</p>

<p>Pamela went down on her knees before the little distracted
lady, and spoke very gently and deliberately as
to a child; and the while she spoke Kitty’s eyes
widened on her smiling countenance as if they beheld an
angel’s.</p>

<p>“Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs has not committed suicide, my
Lady Kilcroney, nor will he do so, because I took the
pistol out of his grasp. Yes, my Lady, I, with these
hands. And I gave him the thirteen pounds you sent
me to pay Mrs. Tabbishaw’s bill. Thirteen pounds!
And he went away to gamble with them at the ‘Six Bells,’
and he was quite sure that he was going to win all his
money back from Lord Sanquhar with the help of them,
and I am quite sure, too, for him. Says he ‘My luck is
turned.’ And——”</p>

<p>She was interrupted.</p>

<p>“And that’s what happened to my Lady’s money. Oh,
you deceitful wretch! Oh, you vile young thief!”</p>

<p>Lydia forgot everything but her indignation. Her
gimlet tones might have disturbed the dead, but neither
my Lady nor Pamela paid the smallest heed to her, for
Kitty Kilcroney had flung herself upon the young milliner’s
neck, and, shedding tears of joy, called her the most
incomparable girl, the noblest creature, the nearest thing
to a seraph that had ever walked a world of woe.</p>

<p>They were both as keen of wit one as the other, and it
was wonderful how, with scarce a question and answer,
the whole story came out.</p>

<p>“You turned into the park, you did not know why?
Ah, but I know why! ’Twas Providence, child. A
most merciful act of Providence! And you saw his
desperate face? Oh, I can scarce bear it! You wrenched
the pistol from his very hand? Oh, if I live to be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
hundred, how can I be grateful enough to Heaven and to
you? Rash and unfortunate young man! You gave
him thirteen pounds? He only asked me for ten. Oh,
where did you say he had gone to? I must send after
him. Lydia, bid the carriage round again. I must go
myself. And you shall go with me, child. Oh, you
shall indeed!”</p>

<p>“Since her Ladyship’s in such a fine mood of generosity,”
cried Lydia, who occasionally presumed on
fourteen years’ service, “perhaps she’ll pay Mrs. Tabbishaw’s
bill over again? Or else my niece will be getting
into trouble, and she needn’t look to me to get her out of
it, lying to my very face!”</p>

<p>Kitty was standing before her mirror, happily setting
her flounces into trim, like a ruffled bird its feathers.</p>

<p>“And why did you never tell me you had such a niece,
Lydia, I should like to know? And what do you mean
by burying a fine young woman like that with a creature
like Tabbishaw? <i>Ugh!</i>”</p>

<p>My Lady’s nerves were pardonably on edge. The
shriek that escaped her as my Lord Kilcroney marched
into the room was as piercing as Lydia’s own.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, my Lord, you’ll be the death of me!
You should have married Susan Verney, you should
indeed, or someone with a cast-iron constitution.
Stay——”</p>

<p>Kitty’s frowns were never of long duration, and she
was in no mood for frowning! “You’ve come in the
very nick of time, my dearest love. Do I not hear your
coach without? Hasten, hasten to the tavern of the
‘Six Bells.’ Pray, where is it, my dear? Oh, doubtless
you know, dearest Denis. And you will ask for Jocelyn
Bellairs. You know, Denis, poor young Bellairs?”</p>

<p>“Faith, then, I’ve been beforehand with you, me
darling!” said my Lord.</p>

<p>He was running Pamela’s straight young figure up and
down with the eye of the connoisseur as he stood there,
a handsome, devil-may-care gentleman; one who patronised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
so superlative a tailor, wore such fine lawns and laces,
and had withal so monstrous elegant a frame whereon
to hang them that a trifle of a loop hanging here or a
button loose there merely pointed to a genteel carelessness.</p>

<p>“Faith, I’ve been beforehand with you! Meeting my
Lord Sanquhar anon, he took me to the ‘Six Bells,’ where
he had a rendezvous with your <i>poor</i> young relative,
Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs. And bejabers,” cried my Lord,
with his favourite Irish oath, “if that young rascal
hasn’t cleaned both me and my Lord Sanquhar as bare as
Mother Hubbard’s cupboard.”</p>

<p>He paused; the investigating eye fixed itself with a
guilty twinkle upon his Kitty’s countenance, where a
mixture of strange emotions were struggling for expression.
And suddenly Lydia clapped her hands and broke into
eldritch laughter. Whereat my Lady also made her
choice of emotions, and laughed too.</p>

<p>“And troth, mavourneen,” said my Lord, delighted
to find the situation so unexpectedly agreeable, “I’m
here to say ’twas you were in the right of it the live-long
night. There’s not a ha’porth of good in trying to force
fortune when the jade has made up her mind to flout ye.
And I’ll take your advice, me darling, and go with you
into the country the moment we get those devils of
I O U’s settled, till it’s time for you to abandon me for
that dashed damnation Court of yours!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t scold you!” cried his wife. “But, oh,
why <i>did</i> you abandon me all day? ’Twas cruel unkind
of you, and I dare swear if you’d been here ’twould never
have happened; for you’d not see a fellow dicer go
wanting for a ten-pound note, my Lord, if I know you!
Oh, read that letter, Denis, and you’ll understand. And
if it had not been for Lydia’s niece here, admirable girl!
who took the pistol out of his very hand in the park, and
gave him her employer’s money—oh, if it were not for
this noble, clever young woman, where should I be now?”</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry about the bill, aunt,” said Pamela,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
with the perfect composure that compelled that person’s
disapproving admiration. “I gave your address to Mr.
Bellairs, and, as he will certainly be punctual with repayment,
her Ladyship will perhaps kindly allow me to remain
until he calls with the money?”</p>

<p>There was nothing my Lady Kilcroney would have
refused Miss Pounce the younger at that moment, and
the milliner’s assistant proceeded to add to her obligations.</p>

<p>“If your Ladyship would trust me with the retrimming
of Miss Mirabel’s hat meanwhile, I make bold to say I
could alter it to your satisfaction——”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">Showing Storm Within and Without</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are some who seem to be destined always to keep
on top as the wheel of life revolves; no matter how others
may suffer from the law of its relentless motion.</p>

<p>My Lady Kilcroney (still in the minds of those who
had first known her in her brilliant widowhood “Incomparable
Bellairs!”) might be counted among the rare
ones who are thus miraculously favoured.</p>

<p>Beauty, wit, charm, wealth, rank and the irresistible
dash of the born leader she had already possessed; now
she had attained to Court favour: she was Lady-in-Waiting
to Queen Charlotte! It is scarcely necessary
to add that she had become a power in the world; should
she choose to exercise her influence on behalf of anyone
clever and virtuous enough to profit of it, that person’s
fortune might be regarded as safe.</p>

<p>So do great planets, following their allotted orbits,
carry in their wake lesser stars that bask and shine in a
reflected light!</p>

<p>In the instance of Miss Pamela Pounce the luminary
thus lifted into prominence, possessed a very considerable
power of shining on her own account; and,
once her position in the hemisphere assured, she required
no borrowed brilliancy.</p>

<p>In other words, my Lady Kilcroney’s recommendation
obtained for Pamela Pounce a new start in life. Madame
Mirabel, exceedingly dissatisfied with her head milliner,
aware that Madame Eglantine of Paris was growing sleek
on the very cream of her rightful British custom, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
being moreover much struck with Pamela’s genteel
appearance, her manner and her aptitude, was all readiness
to oblige so distinguished a client as my Lady
Kilcroney, and give the young woman a trial.</p>

<p>Before the autumn of her disastrous summer had
waned, the younger Miss Pounce found herself firmly
established in the very position which had been the
object of her wildest dream. She was head of the millinery
department of the great Bond Street mantua maker.</p>

<p>Like her unexpected patroness, it might seem that her
cup of happiness was full. But there is no factor in
the calculations of existence so easily forgotten as that
most important item of all; the human heart.</p>

<p>Pamela, in making her courageous plan of life, had
forgotten to reckon with her heart!</p>

<p>And this tiresome, irresponsible, uncontrollable organ
began to trouble her exceedingly. In those hours of
leisure when she was not concocting delightful schemes
for the breaking of other people’s hearts—for every one
knows what a killing hat will do—she found herself considerably
inconvenienced by the peculiar conduct of her
own.</p>

<p>Said Miss Polly Popple, of the millinery department,
to Miss Clara Smithson, the book-keeper:</p>

<p>“You mark my words, my dear, there’s something up
with that young woman Pounce! She’ll be getting
herself into a regular scandal with that dashing young
spark of hers! And if she ain’t got something on her
conscience already ... I don’t know the signs!”</p>

<p>Miss Smithson leant forward, wheezing heavily.</p>

<p>“Providence ain’t always unjust, Polly,” she said,
“and people do come by their rights, no matter how
many viscountesses is against them!”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Polly, swelling her fine bust, and looking
at herself in the fly-blown glass which hung over the
chimney in the little room at the back of the Bond Street
shop where she was sitting, after hours, with her friend.
“That was a bit of jobbery, that was! There isn’t one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
in the establishment, I do believe, that wasn’t struck all
of a heap when they heard that a strange young female
was put into old Mrs. Dodder’s place instead of me,
which the next in rank is always, by law, you might say,
entitled to. Lady Kilcroney being that prodigious in
the fashion—not that I was ever one to admire her;
give me breeding!—and Madame Mirabel being so set on
cutting out Madame Eglantine—not that she ever will,
and you mark my words, for London ain’t Paris, I say,
and that I’ll maintain, and you may talk yourself blue
in the face, Clara, and you won’t alter that! If it hadn’t
been for that put-up job, ’tis I’d have been head of the
millinery here this moment.”</p>

<p>Miss Polly Popple’s case was clear, but Miss Smithson’s
reasons for disliking Pamela were perhaps more
abstruse. She talked big of the claims of friendship, of
her sympathy for Miss Popple, and also of a “rising
within her,” which with her was an infallible sign of
“something fishy” in somebody else. But the truth
was that the new-comer’s radiant youth, her success, her
spirit of enterprise, had started the base passion of envy
in Miss Smithson’s withered breast; a passion the more
prejudicial that it flourishes entirely outside the pale of
reason! She listened very greedily, therefore, to Miss
Popple’s rapid exposition of her suspicions. Between
gossip, malice, and inventiveness, the new head milliner’s
character seemed indeed in a parlous condition when
Miss Popple concluded.</p>

<p>That wheezing breath of Miss Smithson’s was drawn
with ever-increased intensity.</p>

<p>“Walking with the young gentleman late of an evening
in the Green Park! Upon my word! If it had been
you that had seen her last night, now, Miss Popple dear,
instead of that poor foundling of a Mary Jane, which
Madame Mirabel was saying only yesterday could scarce
be trusted to match a skein of blue silk, I’d go to Madame
Mirabel this minute with it, I would, being so to speak,
a cousin——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Beware what you does, Miss Smithson, you’ll ruin
all. Give her rope.”</p>

<p>“Rope, Miss Popple?”</p>

<p>“Rope to hang herself with,” said Miss Popple vindictively.
“That’s in a manner of speaking. Plain,
she’ll give herself away or he’ll give her away,” she had
an ill-natured giggle, “so as we give them time. It’s his
game to give her away, a devil-may-care hand, some
young buck who only wants to have her at his mercy,
just for his fun. Wasn’t he after her here—open—three
afternoons out of last week?”</p>

<p>“After her here?” Miss Smithson again repeated
her friend’s last words. She was exceedingly shocked.</p>

<p>“Why, mercy to goodness,” she went on in horrified
tones: “Ain’t it the rule of the house? No male
belongings is allowed after the young ladies here if
they were grandfathers itself. And they churchwardens.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tush, Smithson,” interrupted Polly contemptuously.
“Of course my sly young beau comes dangling
in with some lady friend, to help her to choose a hat—<i>by
way of</i>—” Polly winked. “Toosday, it was Mrs. Lafone
as brought him, or, to be correct, he brought her, which,
knowing the minx as I do—I refers here to Mrs. Lafone—’tis
my intimate conviction ’tis he will pay for that
there hat! But, as you knows, Miss Smithson, and none
better, ladies’ morals ain’t our concern, thanks be, so
long as we keeps our own respectable.”</p>

<p>Miss Smithson admitted this regrettable truth with a
doleful sigh. Polly took another pull at the brew of hot
spiced beer which they had concocted for their comfort
this cold December night, and proceeded:</p>

<p>“Thursday, if Mr. Stafford doesn’t bring him along
all innocent! He, with his handsome lady on his arm,
up from Windsor for the day, to buy her a stylish head
for a Christmas present. And, ‘What are you doing,
looking in at a hat-shop window, Bellairs,’ says he, laughing
and joking (’tis his way, my dear, a very agreeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
gentleman!) ‘Gad,’ says he, ‘you’ve not got a wife to
run you up bills! Your chinkers goes hopping out on
hosses and dice and cards, and what not! Selfish fellows
you bachelors are!’ And Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs, bowing
to Mr. Stafford and declaring he only wished he had other
people’s luck—and indeed, Miss Smithson, Mrs. Stafford
is a real beauty!—but all the while, my dear, who is he
looking at and ogling and taking occasion to whisper to—but
Miss Pounce, if you please! And if I didn’t see the
way her kerchief lace was quivering with the palpitation
of her heart, and her hands shaking as she took down
heads for Mrs. Stafford and held them up for her—well,
my name’s not Popple.”</p>

<p>Miss Smithson leant over the sulky coal fire and lifted
the saucepan from the hob to refill her glass. Her own
hands shook. That Pamela was a disgrace and would
bring discredit on the whole house of Mirabel! She felt
it in her bones.</p>

<p>“You may say so, dear.” As her friend drank, Polly
Popple tendered her own tumbler for replenishment, murmuring
parenthetically, however: (“Not a drop more,
love. I never did hold with stimulants, only you were so
pressing and it is a foggy night, I won’t deny, and a drop
of cordial, a mere medical precaution, so to speak)—you
may say so,” the slighted young lady of the bonnet
department took up her theme with fresh gusto. “And
you’d say so a million times more if you had seen them
to-day. For Mr. Jocelyn comes in with my Lady Kilcroney—and
oh! the bold brazenness of it!—there he
stands behind my Lady’s chair and Pounce—La! I
declare I’d have been sorry for her if she wasn’t what she
is, the baggage—red and white and not knowing where
to put her eyes with him signalling to her. Yes, and if
he did not thrust a letter into her hand as I went out,
you may set me down a liar. And her stuffing it into
her kerchief under my very nose!”</p>

<p>“Don’t, dear, don’t,” moaned Miss Smithson, beating
the air with her bony hand. Then, after a long pause,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
during which she seemed to be painfully bringing her
virginal mind to confront the awful pictures just presented
to it, she went on acridly: “There’ll be a bust
up. When a girl comes to that <i>pint</i> of disreputableness
things is bound to happen. It can’t go on like this—you
mark my words.”</p>

<p>Now, strangely enough, barring the inexactitude of the
premise, such a conclusion had just formed itself in
Pamela’s own mind.</p>

<p>It could not go on. Something was bound to happen.
She had saved the life of Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs; and he had
demonstrated his gratitude by promptly falling head
over heels in love with her. So far, so good; or rather,
so far, so bad, where a dashing young gentleman of
expensive habits, small principle and remarkable fascination
and a young person of the working classes are
concerned. For the mischief of it was she had fallen in
love with him. Poor Pamela, with her high spirit, her
clear brain and her strong courage, to be betrayed by a
heart as vulnerable as any silly girl’s of the lot! She was
clear-sighted enough to know that, stripped of the golden
glamour, the path of her romance led to a very ugly gulf.
She despised herself for her weakness. She had no
illusions on the quality of the attachment offered to her
by Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs, but, as the short December days
dropped away to Christmas, she found, growing within
her, a dangerous new self; a reckless creature who cried:
<i>The Devil might take the consequences; a girl was young but
once; you found your fate, and had to clasp him or lose him;
the one man you could love, and him only, or go wanting to
your grave!</i></p>

<p>“I know it’s death and destruction some time,” said
Pamela to herself, sitting hugging her knees in the neat
little chamber in Shepherd Street, where she lodged with
a most respectable widow woman who had once seen
better times, “but isn’t it death and destruction anyhow
and at once if I have to give him up?”</p>

<p>She re-read the letter he had slipped into her hand—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
audacious fellow—a few hours ago at Madame
Mirabel’s.</p>

<p class="center">“<i>It must be yes or no, my darling lovely girl.</i>”</p>

<p>My darling, lovely girl. That was what his eyes were
always saying, and oh! it was sweet!</p>

<p>It must be yes or no! She told herself that if she
couldn’t say yes, it was still more impossible to say no.
Backwards and forwards she struggled with the insolvable
problem, till her tallow candle expired with a
great stench, and she was left in darkness and misery.
Worn out with her long day she fell at last asleep, to be
wakened by the call of a cock in Shepherd’s Market.
Perhaps it was this farmyard cry which, weaving into her
consciousness, had made her dream so strongly of the old
place at home. When she woke she could hardly believe
she was not in the billowing four-poster in the great attic,
with pretty Sister Susie asleep beside her.</p>

<p>Again the cold, foggy, bleak London morning was rent
by the crow of the cock. Then Pamela knew where she
was, and she knew something else, too.</p>

<p>That other self which had got into her must not be
listened to on any account. It must indeed be stamped
out of existence with the utmost promptitude.</p>

<p>Now Pamela was considerably wiser than most young
women in her position. She took a sensible resolution.</p>

<p>“I’ll go to Mrs. Mirabel this very morning,” she
decided, “and ask for a Christmas holiday. She won’t
refuse me, being the good-natured soul she is, and me so
useful to her. And once I get home and feel mother’s
arms about me—there! I know I’ll be all right. I
needn’t be afraid of myself any more.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Pamela Pounce took seat in the Dover coach. She was
in a sedate flutter, an admirably dignified bustle. She
knew to the fraction of an inch the amount of space to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
which she was entitled, and she possessed herself of it
determinedly. She had, besides her own agreeable
person, divers bandboxes and loose parcels to place, and
this she did with an amiable assurance that put protest
to the blush, and set other passengers’ pretensions in a
gross light. When her arrangements were concluded
she heaved a sigh, presented a vague smile, and lay back,
her hands folded, to survey the other travellers at leisure.
She was herself better worth looking at than any of the
coach-load, which contained a foreign couple, one or two
of the usual bagmen on the road to France, a Dover shopkeeper,
a farmer’s wife, and an elderly gentleman of
delicate and serious mien, who drew an old calf-bound
volume from a shabby bag, and fixed large gold-mounted
spectacles upon his high, transparent nose
with all the air of one prepared with solace for the
journey.</p>

<p>But as he sat exactly opposite Miss Pamela Pounce, his
shrewd, cold eyes wandered ever and anon from the print
to fix itself upon her, as though—which was indeed the
fact—he were puzzled in what category to place her.
It was obvious to Sir Edward Cheveral, who, though
impoverished, was himself a gentleman of the first water,
that the ambulent nymph in front of him was not of his
class, perfect as was the fit of her grey riding coat, refined
and reposeful as were the hands in their long grey gloves,
tasteful in its coquettishness as was the grey riding toque,
set on chestnut curls, and suitably as these curling
tresses, unpowdered, were smoothed away to be tied
with a wide black ribbon at the back of the long proud
throat.</p>

<p>In the first instance, no young person of family with
such claims to distinction as her elaborate travelling gear
pointed to, would be voyaging in the public coach
unattended; in the second, in her quiet ease, and
the full yet not immodest assurance of her glance,
the manners of one accustomed to fight the world for
herself were very obvious; in the third, there was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
indefinable lack of the never-to-be-mistaken stamp of
breeding.</p>

<p>“For all your clever counterfeit, my good girl,”
reflected Sir Everard, “you haven’t the ring of the guinea
gold.”</p>

<p>Yet he reproached himself for the accusation. Here
was, after all, no counterfeit; very good metal of its kind.
“Fine yellow brass,” thought he with a chuckle. “All
in a good sense, my dear.”</p>

<p>What was she? From whence and whither speeding?
Not an actress. That fresh, close-textured skin had never
known paint on its flower-like surface. The cheeks were
not even rouged; indeed, after the flush of bustle, the
colour of them was now settling back in a curious ivory
pallor, which went well with the ardent hair. No fine
lady’s young woman; every movement had betrayed
conscious independence. A shop-girl? The wife of
some small merchant? Nay, ’twas the impersonation
of maiden liberty, and what shop-girl could encompass
such a wealth and detail of modishness?</p>

<p>She caught his gaze upon her, leaned forward and
smiled. He had already noticed that her smile was
rather dazzling. He quite blinked to find it addressed
to himself.</p>

<p>“I trust, sir,” said she, “my bandboxes do not incommode
you?”</p>

<p>“By no means, madam,” answered he civilly; and
moved his long, thin legs back a further fraction beneath
the seat.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been home,” said she, “for four years, and
luggage do grow when one has five young sisters at home,
sir, and presents run to hats.”</p>

<p>“To hats?” he repeated, with that interested air
that obviates the audacity of a question.</p>

<p>“Along, sir,” said Miss Pounce, and her smile broadened,
“with me being in the millinery business.”</p>

<p>She drew herself up with a very pretty and, to his mind,
becoming pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“A business,” he said, “which I take it, madam, is in
a flourishing condition.”</p>

<p>“You may say so, sir.” Her pride increased. “Since
Miss Pamela Pounce—that’s me!—has been made head of
the department, Madame Mirabel can scarce execute the
vast number of orders.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word!” He had removed his spectacles,
and was smiling on her in his turn in a kindly, detached,
faintly satiric way. “I trust Madame What’s-Her-Name
recognises her debt to you?”</p>

<p>The head milliner gave her curls ever so slight a
toss.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, she wouldn’t like to lose me. She knows
I’m worth my weight in gold to her.”</p>

<p>His glance flickered over her comely proportions.
Tall, generously made, he had called her a nymph.
“Goddess would have been the better appellation,”
murmured he.</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis a comfort to an old man like myself to meet
one so youthful to whom work is proving both fruitful
and blessed.”</p>

<p>Miss Pamela Pounce didn’t need any old gentleman to
commend her. She knew the value of work, and who
better? And if it was blessed to her, why she took good
care that it should be. And, as to content with her lot—sure,
if she hadn’t been, she wasn’t a fool, she’d have
picked out another for herself.</p>

<p>“’Tis some old clergyman,” she thought, and laughed.
“He’ll scarce know what a hat means. Clergyman’s
wives and daughters in the country would give any
woman of taste bad dreams for a fortnight. There was
Mrs. Prue Stafford. Had she not still to learn that to
wear pink and blue with such cheeks as she had was
positive vulgar? And she married to the finest of fine
gentlemen.”</p>

<p>Sir Everard folded his spectacles, put them carefully
into his breast pocket, and closed his Virgil. Here was
an opportunity of studying a—to him—hitherto quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
unknown branch of humanity, after an unexpectedly
pleasant fashion. The girl pleased him. He had called
her brass and humoured the simile. A shining, solid
composition of metal that took a handsome polish and
showed itself boldly for what it was. He liked her for
her spring of youth, her frank pride of her trade, for
having no petty nonsense nor poor pretentiousness to
pass for what she was not. He liked her brave independence.
There was, he thought, a better modesty in her
quiet certainty than any prudish airs and graces could
have lent her.</p>

<p>“’Twould be a presuming fellow,” he mused, “that
would dare to try his gallant ways with such an one, and
if he did, I would back my young milliner to teach him
a lesson.”</p>

<p>She told him how she had, so to speak, graduated in
Paris, which accounted, thought he, for a taste that was
scarcely indigenous. And her home was between Canterbury
and Dover, and she, brought up till seventeen on
the farm, the eldest of eleven. Then he knew whence
she had drawn that sap of splendid vigour; a hardy
flower of English soil. And the chief of his many prides
being that he was an Englishman, he was still better
content.</p>

<p>She would alight, she told him, at “The Rose” at
Canterbury, where she would lie the night. And father
would fetch her in the morning; for ’twas mortal cold
across the downs on a winter’s evening, and ’twas a long
drive for the mare even in good weather.</p>

<p>“Bravo,” said he. “I, too, halt at ‘The Rose,’ I am
glad to know that I shall have such good company. May
I sit beside you at supper in the eating-room, my dear
young lady?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re vastly obliging, sir!” said Pamela Pounce,
and a faint pink crept, like the colour of a shell, into her
smooth, pale cheek, for she had a good eye for a gentleman,
and she knew that she was honoured.</p>

<p>Her tongue ran on gaily, and he listened with a gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
air of courtesy and an interest which in truth was not
assumed.</p>

<p>In spite of her sophisticated manner her chatter was very
artless. It was a revelation of a character which had
remained curiously untouched by the world. The busy
mart in which she lived had cast none of its dust upon
her soul.</p>

<p>Dear, to be sure, how prodigious joyful they would be
at home to see her back!</p>

<p>“Four years, sir, think on it! I was but a child when
I left them, and now I’m a woman!” ’Twas like,
indeed, that none would recognise her again, should they
just happen to meet, accidental like. She half wished
she could have walked in upon them and taken them by
surprise. But then: “Father, sir, would ha’ lost the
pleasure of coming to fetch me,” and her mother might
have been vexed. “Mother’s very house-proud, sir.
She’d want to have things pretty for me, and bake cakes
and that.”</p>

<p>And they’d all be looking out for her on the house step.
Just to think of their dear faces fair turned her silly.
She blinked away a tear and gave her bright smile. But
as he smiled back it was with a certain melancholy. The
farmer with his eleven children—poor, struggling fellow!—the
hardworked mother, the good, industrious child,
returning home with her hands full of gifts, blessed in
her honest toil for them, were they not all about to taste
joys from which he had deliberately cut himself off in his
fastidious isolation? He had scarcely ever regretted his
chosen solitariness. His beautiful old shabby home, set
in the loneliness of the snowy park, the wood fire in the
library in the company of a favourite book, the ministrations
of a couple of well-drilled servants, an austere
silence, a harmonious communion with the high spirits
of the dead; that was the Christmas to which he himself
had looked forward with complacency. Now he wondered;
his heart contracted with a most unusual sense of
pain; had he lost the best in life? If he had had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
daughter by his shoulder with a white, pure forehead
such as this girl had, and had seen her eyes fire with
love, heard her voice tremble at the thought of meeting
him, her old father, would not that have brought
him a sweetness finer than the most exquisite page in
Virgil?</p>

<p>The day, which had opened blue and gold, with a high
wind and clear sunshine, began to gather threatening
clouds by the time the posting station was reached; and
the “Dover High-Flyer” plunged away again into a
snow squall with all the speed of its fresh horses.</p>

<p>“We are like to have a seasonable Christmas,” quoth
Sir Everard, and was pleased to note that, while the rest
of the company grumbled and complained, the fine
specimen of young womanhood opposite to him produced
a warm shawl from a bundle, tucked it round her knees,
and offered him the other end, declaring, with a smile,
that she was as warm as a toast, and that she did love a
white Christmas.</p>

<p>They all dined at Rochester, and had hot punch, of
which Miss Pounce partook with enthusiasm, but in
very discreet measure.</p>

<p>Conversation flagged on this, their last, stage. The
snoring of the foreign pair who, having tied their heads up
in terrible coloured handkerchiefs, leant against each
other and gave themselves up to repose with much the
same animal abandonment as that with which they had
gobbled the beef-steak pie and gulped the hot rum of
the “Bull Inn” at Rochester; the sighing fidgets of the
farmer’s wife, and the grunts of her neighbour, the Dover
tradesman, each time they jarred him from a fitful
somnolence, alone broke the inner silence. Without,
the multiple rhythm of the horses hoofs and the varying
answer of the road to the wheels—now the scrunch of
cobble stones, now the slushy whisper of the snow-filled
rut, now the whirring ring of a well-metalled stretch—formed
a monotonous whole which lulled to silence those
who could not sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>Sir Everard saw, by the shifting flicker of the lamps,
how pensiveness gathered on the bright face opposite
him. Once or twice the girl raised a finger to the corner
of her eyelid as if to press back a rising tear; sighs lifted
her bosom.</p>

<p>“Ah!” thought the old philosopher, “the goddess
of modes is not so fancy free as I had thought. Here,
truly, are all the signs of a gentle love tale. Perhaps the
young man in the counting-house, or some sprightly
haberdasher, who sees Miss pass to her work, and would
fain capture for his own counter a face so fair and charming.”</p>

<p>Sir Everard felt very old and stiff by the time Canterbury
was reached, and half regretted his suggestion to his
travelling companion, to continue their comradeship at
supper. He thought it might have better become his
years and aching bones to retire into a feather bed with
a basin of gruel. Far indeed was he from guessing the
singular emotions into which his old age was destined
to be plunged that evening.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A fine room with a four-poster, no less indeed than
the chamber which went by the name of “Great
Queen Anne,” this was what the landlord proposed to
allot to Sir Everard. A chimney you couldn’t beat
in the kingdom for drawing, mine host averred, and
a fire there this minute; agreeable to Sir Everard’s
obliging communication. And what could he do for
Miss?</p>

<p>Sir Everard was a little shocked to hear Miss Pounce
enter upon a brisk bargain for an attic, and hesitatingly
began a courteous offer of his own apartment, when
she interrupted him with the valiant good sense which
he had already had cause to admire in her.</p>

<p>“Not at all, sir! ’Tis what suits my station—so long
as the sheets are clean and there’s a good bolt to the
door; you’ll promise me that, Mr. Landlord? And if
you can’t spare a warming pan, sure a hot brick will do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
vastly well. And now, sir, give me time to see my bandboxes
in safety, and I’m for supper.”</p>

<p>Even as she spoke she started. Her eye became fixed,
her lips fell open upon a gasp of amazement. The
healthy white bloom of her countenance turned to deathly
pallor, and then a tide of blood rushed crimsoning to her
forehead. Beholding this evidence of strong emotion,
it scarcely needed the sight that met Sir Everard’s
glance as he followed the direction of her eyes to
confirm his instant conclusion. The young man, of
course! Stay, the young man is a gentleman—poor
nymph! Here then were joy, and fear, confusion, the
warning of conscience, and artless passion, all mixed
together.</p>

<p>The young gentleman advanced; a fine buck, of the
very kind, thought Sir Everard, who took an instantaneous
dislike to him, to turn the head of any girl beneath
him in station, whom he might honour with his conquering
regard. There was a black and white handsomeness
about his chiselled countenance; all the powder in the
world could not disguise that those jet eyebrows were
matched with a raven spring of hair. With a smile, a
dilation of nostrils, a swagger of broad shoulders, a
leisurely step of high-booted legs, he came forward out
of the tap-room. No surprise on his side: my gentleman
had planned the meeting.</p>

<p>“La, Mr. Bellairs!” Pamela Pounce exclaimed, and
her voice trembled. Then she rallied, and strove to
pursue with lightness, “who ever would have thought
of seeing you here?”</p>

<p>He took her hand and lifted it to his lips with an
exaggerated courtesy, as if he mocked himself for it the
while.</p>

<p>“Why, did I not guess rightly, my dear, you would
be spending a lonely evening here on your way home?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Bellairs!”</p>

<p>He kept her hand in his, to draw her apart. Sir
Everard, gazing at them, his chin sunk in his muffler,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
with severe, sad eyes, saw how she swayed towards him,
as she went into the window recess, as if her very soul
floated on the music of his voice. He watched them
whisper ardently together, and then she went by him
like a tornado, picking up her bandboxes as she passed,
quite oblivious of his presence, or of anything, apparently,
save the young rascal, so Sir Everard apostrophised him,
who stood gazing after her with the same insufferable
smile; the smile of the easy conqueror.</p>

<p>Sir Everard never had had a high opinion of women.
Life had given him no reason to indulge in illusions. But
now all his condemnation was for the man. The strong,
self-reliant creature who had faced him all those weary
hours with such unalterable good humour, such a candid
outlook, such a pleasant acceptance of her own position
that it was the next thing to high breeding, what was
this Captain Lothario planning to make of her? And
how, since he had found her already so hard to win that
he must travel to Canterbury for the purpose, did she
now thus readily yield herself to his plucking hand?
Ay, the villain had struck at some peril point in the life
of her soul. The child was tired after her long journey;
tired too, perhaps, by the mental conflict from which
her integrity had hitherto emerged triumphant. A
sudden assault had found the fortress unprepared.
’Twas the old story!</p>

<p>Sir Everard went wearily to his room. The thought
of the feather bed and the gruel, of a selfish withdrawal
from further association with what was like to end in
sordid tragedy tempted him perhaps, but he did not
yield to it. The girl’s smile haunted him. It had been
so brightly innocent; and he was haunted, too, by the
last memory of her face, stricken with astonishment,
quivering with joy. However she might fall, it would
not be through light-mindedness. The folly, the misery,
was deep rooted in her poor heart.</p>

<p>He made a careful toilet, and went down the slippery
oak stairs, leaning on his gold-headed cane, looking a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
very great personage indeed, delicately austere and
nobly haughty.</p>

<p>Alas! Pamela never so much as lifted her radiant head
when he came into the eating-room. She was seated
beside her gallant at the end of the table in close
conversation—that whispered, blushing, laughing,
sighing conversation of lovers—and if the roof had
fallen over them, Sir Everard thought, the two would
scarce have noticed it, so absorbed were they in each
other.</p>

<p>The young man had ordered champagne, and the girl’s
glass was filled, but the bubbling wine had barely been
touched. Another intoxication, more deadly and more
sure, was working through her veins. The old philosopher,
seeing her condition, resigned for the moment all thought
of interference, and sat down to his bottle of claret and
bowl of broth.</p>

<p>Hardly, however, had he broken his hot roll, than the
room was invaded by fresh arrivals; a young woman,
wrapped in furs, conducted by a gentleman who had
not removed his travelling coat, and kept his hat pressed
on his brows; a personage who entered with an intolerable
arrogance as if the place belonged to him, who
ordered champagne and supper for the lady, and fresh
horses for his coach, in a voice which rang like the crack
of a whip. He could not wait; the servers must bustle.
A guinea each to the ostlers if they harnessed within ten
minutes. “And, hark ye, sirrah, a bottle of your best
Sillery, and——”</p>

<p>“Surely I know this autocratic fellow,” thought Sir
Everard, and as the traveller drew his companion with
an imperative sweep of his arm about her, to the end of
the table opposite to that at which Mr. Bellairs and his
Dulcinea were seated. “My Lord Sanquhar!” cried
Sir Everard, “by all that’s outrageous! And who in
the name of pity is his victim now?”</p>

<p>That the two were lovers, of a stage considerably more
advanced than the poor milliner and her Beau, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
obvious to the onlooker, and as my Lord Sanquhar now
tore his hat from his head, to dash the snow that covered
it into the fire, where it hissed and spluttered like a curse,
the young woman who accompanied him let herself fall
on to the settle and turned a look of darkling challenge,
of brooding suspicion, into the room.</p>

<p>She was clad in the most sumptuous garments. There
was a bloom of royal purple against the tawny clouds of
her sables. There was a fire of ruby at her throat,
caught up and repeated at each ear, as if deep gouts of
a lover’s blood had taken to themselves flame for her
adorning. But the countenance she turned upon the
room was, Sir Everard thought, so striking, that all this
splendour seemed its natural attribute; striking with a
Spanish beauty, a richness and depth of colour, with
flashing orbs, high nostrils, and scarlet lips.</p>

<p>“Good Heavens!” Sir Everard mused, “where has
he picked the jade? Victim? Nay, ’tis the kind that
keeps a knife in her stocking and will whip it out and
under your rib, and make an end of you with less ado
than another will shed a tear. My Lord Sanquhar
will have to look out for himself. Illicit love is a
dangerously charged atmosphere in which to handle live
gunpowder.”</p>

<p>The “Dover High-Flyer” had only dropped two of
its passengers at “The Rose,” and the landlord was free
to attend to his imperious guest. He himself served my
Lord Sanquhar’s champagne, and with bent back received
his “pishs” and “pshaws” on the dearth of
proper entertainment for the lady. She wanted fresh
fruit, and there was none. She asked for chocolate, and
pettishly refused to touch it. One sniff was enough.
All her desires and denials she communicated in a guttural
undertone to her companion, who translated them into
oaths.</p>

<p>Sir Everard, who had had but a poor appetite, was
now, his broth bowl pushed on one side, dipping bits of
roll into his wine after a foreign fashion, and watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
the while the two sets of lovers at the further end of the
room. He noticed, not without some satisfaction, that
constraint had fallen upon the ardent Bellairs and his
fair milliner. The colour on the young man’s face
fluctuated. He bit his lip and shot doubtful looks of
question from the blatant couple to the downcast
countenance of his companion, who had grown very pale,
scarcely spoke, and seemed now and again as if she was
struggling with tears.</p>

<p>A clatter of hoofs, the clang of a bell, and a shout from
the door announced another guest, a solitary horseman,
it seemed. The landlord, who was just entering the
room with a plate of dried plums in the hope of tempting
the appetite of the capricious lady—he had scented my
Lord’s quality with unerring nose—here thrust the dish
into the hands of a waiter and turned back to receive the
newcomer. He had left the door open behind him and
all could hear the passionate explosion of a hoarse voice
in the hall.</p>

<p>The dark little lady on the settle by the fire sprang to
her feet, and stood, tense. Her companion gave a swift
frowning look of surprise. Sir Everard, gazing upon
her also, drew a quick breath. “By the immortal gods,”
said he to himself, “the drama is coming swifter than
one could have imagined.” And, indeed, what the
ancient quiet inn was destined to hold for the next ten
minutes in the way of human passion, conflict, and
tragedy, might happily be never as much as guessed at
in the lifetime of most men.</p>

<p>The landlord, his wig awry, his features discomposed,
puffing and blustering, was vainly endeavouring to
prevent the ingress of a small thick-set man, who though
wrapped in a cloak and carrying some considerable
burden, which he kept hidden under its folds, contrived
by a single violent thrust of his shoulder, to send him
spinning out of the way. The intruder advanced then
at a headlong run, brought himself up short, flung back
his cloak, and with the same gesture his hat, and stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
revealed, swarthy, grizzled, livid, panting through dilated
nostrils, glaring upon the woman by the settle. There
was a great flare of colour on his broad chest, where,
wound in a scarlet shawl, a little child of about two,
with a head of curls of that dark copper hue destined to
turn black with years, lay placidly asleep; the curve of
a plump apricot cheek was all that was visible of its
face.</p>

<p>“Good heavens,” said Sir Everard, and at the sight of
the sleeping innocence, something in his old heart began
to lament.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s extraordinary silence, broken
only by the breathing of the man with the child, which
hissed through his set teeth like the strokes of a saw.
Then my Lord Sanquhar laughed.</p>

<p>The man leaped as if he had been struck. A torrent
of words broke from him—guttural, fierce, intolerably
anguished. Sir Everard knew a little Spanish.</p>

<p>The unfortunate was pleading: “Come back, come
back! I will forgive all. Come back, Dolores, you
cannot leave us. You cannot leave the little one. Come
back in the name of God, in the name of His Holy Mother.
<i>Madre di Dios</i>, look at her! You cannot leave that!
Ah! unhappy one, you want gold and jewels. Was not
our love your treasure? Is not our child a pearl? Look
at her!”</p>

<p>In singular contrast to the unrestrained violence of
his outburst, the manner in which he held out the child
was pure tender. The little one woke, stared about her
with devouring black eyes of amazement, caught sight
of the standing woman’s face and cried, joyfully beating
the air with minute dusky hands, “Mamma, mamma!”</p>

<p>At this a sob burst from the unhappy father, so deep
and tortured it was as if it rent him.</p>

<p>“Dolores, our little girl, she calls you ‘Mamma,
mamma!’ Call again my angel! ‘Mamma, mamma!’”</p>

<p>He went down on his knees and held out the babe, and
as he did so she wailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>The mother, meanwhile, stood, insolent lids half
closed, red lips thrust forward, tapping the floor with
impatient foot, the embodiment of cruel disdain.</p>

<p>At her child’s cry she stuffed her fingers into her ears
with savage gesture, stamped, and flung a raging glance
at her lover as one who said, “How long am I to endure
this?”</p>

<p>He answered it by the movement of a beckoning
finger, which brought her to his side. Then he cast a
gold piece on the table, clapped his hat on his head, and
together they moved towards the door.</p>

<p>“Ah! By the blessed saints!”</p>

<p>The Spaniard in a bound was before them. He shook
the screaming infant in their faces as if it had been a
weapon.</p>

<p>“I swear this shall not be. I swear that I shall kill
you and your paramour and the child and myself rather
than that this shall be.”</p>

<p>It was here that Pamela caught the little one from him.
He was perhaps too far gone in passion to notice the
action; perhaps he was glad to have his hands free for
his fierce purpose—anyhow, he relaxed his hold. And
the girl, clasping the baby in her arms, hushing it and
soothing it, ran with it to the further end of the room.
Sir Everard had also risen and Bellairs had started
forward. But it would have been as easy to baulk a
wild cat of its leap as to arrest the betrayed husband
in his spring upon his betrayer.</p>

<p>No one ever quite knew how it happened. There was
the flash of a knife, an oath, and my Lord Sanquhar’s
“Damn you, you would have it!” and the explosion of
a pistol.</p>

<p>The Spaniard fell without a groan, right across the
doorway. Sir Everard and Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs both
knew that he was a dead man before he touched the
ground.</p>

<p>“You are witness all,” said my Lord Sanquhar, “that
this was in self-defence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>The woman cast a backward glance into the room.
Her rich bloom had faded. She was white, but with a
palpitating whiteness as of fire at its intensest, and the
gaze of her great eyes was as fire too. Almost red they
shone, repeating the blood fires of the rubies. Then
she gave herself to Lord Sanquhar’s embrace, and together
they rushed out into the night.</p>

<p>“Odds my life!” said Mr. Bellairs, looking up at Sir
Everard. He had flung himself on one knee beside the
stricken man, and was going through the vain parade
of seeking for a pulse which he knew no longer beat.
“Did you see that, sir?”</p>

<p>“He lifted her across her husband’s very body! He
lifted her right across the body?” said Sir Everard, in
a hushed voice of disgust.</p>

<p>“Lifted her? Sir, she jumped!”</p>

<p>Pamela kept the child’s face turned against her breast
with a loving hand, and as she rocked and soothed, she
herself wept as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>Through the doors, cast open to the night, the roar of
a new snow wind hurtled in upon them. There followed
a sudden clamour of voices, as the host endeavoured to
arrest my lord’s departure and was borne down, well-nigh
annihilated, from his path; the crackling shout of
my lord’s orders; the plunge and clatter of hoofs on the
cobbles. It seemed as if the blood-guilty pair had gone
on the wings of the storm, and that the very elements
cried after them as they went.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Sir Everard, as the most responsible witness, assisted
the landlord in the preliminary investigation of magistrate
and constable. He took a certain grim pleasure in
furnishing Lord Sanquhar’s name, and trusted the nobleman
might be summoned to answer for his action. Even
if acquittal were a foregone conclusion, to a reputation
already tarnished this incident was not likely to add a
lustre. By the quality of the murdered man’s clothes,
the massive gold of his watch-chain, the signet ring on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
his dead hand, it was judged that he was a merchant of
the better class, and that the unfortunate incident would
probably make some stir among his compatriots.</p>

<p>The cold and stiffening body which had been so short
a while before pulsing with agony and passion, was laid
in the harness-room of the inn, covered with a white sheet.
Scarce ten yards away the grey horse that had borne its
rider on the wild race to death was placidly munching its
corn, the sweat not yet dry on its flanks.</p>

<p>When Sir Everard returned to the eating-room he
found Pamela still on the settle, the child asleep on her
lap. On the board beside her a half-finished bowl of
bread and milk showed that she had been occupied with
the worse than motherless babe, while he had attended
to the last concerns of its doomed father. On the
other side of the hearth, one elbow propped on the high
mantelshelf, stood Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs. The old man’s
entrance had evidently interrupted a conversation between
the two lovers, of an interest so vital that both the
faces now turned upon him were stamped with fierce
emotion.</p>

<p>Sir Everard removed a chair from before the table and
sat down on it facing the fire, and for a space no one
spoke.</p>

<p>Pamela had cast the scarlet shawl across one shoulder
so as to shade the child’s head from the light. Her
hand patted and her knees swayed, rocking the infant
sleeper.</p>

<p>“Poor little creature!” said Sir Everard at last.</p>

<p>The girl gave him a quick glance.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep her to-night. I’ve told the landlord I would,
and I’d keep her always if I could.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a generous thought,” said the old gentleman,
with a faint smile for the magnanimous impractibilities
of youth, and as he smiled he was aware that Mr. Bellairs
snapped his fingers and jerked his foot on the edge of
irritable outburst.</p>

<p>Suddenly Pamela began to sob quickly under her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
breath; turned her head aside so that her tears should not
fall on the little placid face.</p>

<p>“I’ve been a wicked girl! A wicked girl!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” cried Mr. Bellairs, and flung out his hand.</p>

<p>“No, sir; I won’t be silent!”</p>

<p>“But, good God, my dear, need you drag this stranger
into our intimate concerns?”</p>

<p>“He’s no stranger to me, Mr. Bellairs. We travelled
down in the coach together, and he couldn’t have been
more civil to me if I’d been a lady born; no, nor kinder
if he’d been my father. Oh, sir, I don’t know your name,
but I know by the pitying way you looked at me that you
understood what dreadful danger I was in and how—”
again she sobbed—“how ready I was to yield to it! He
wanted me to go to Paris with him. He did, indeed!
He wanted his love to be my all-in-all, and nothing else
was to matter. I’ve been a wicked girl! I listened to
him. I never would listen to him before—not when he
spoke like that—but to-night I did. Heaven forgive me!
What took me?”</p>

<p>“Confound!” said Mr. Bellairs.</p>

<p>He wheeled away from the sight of her weeping,
clutched the mantelpiece with both hands, and dropped
his head on them.</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis all over now.”</p>

<p>Sir Everard spoke uneasily. This openness upon a
subject so delicate was painful to him, but Pamela had
the yearning to relieve herself by confession.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, how could I do it? I don’t know myself.
I swear when I look back ’tis as if I had not been myself
at all. Something came into me—so rash, so desperate!
’Twas as if nothing mattered but just his love, our love.
And then—then—when those two came in I saw our sin
as it was. Oh, heavens! Oh, Heaven forgive me! Murder
and every evil was there. Would I not have been just
as cruel, done just as horrid murder? When the truth
came out, would my father and mother and my own dear
loves at home, waiting for me so fond and so trusting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and so proud of their poor, silly Pam, ever have held up
their heads again? Oh, base, base! I would have
murdered them for my pleasure. And that love, what
was it? The thing that those two looked at each other,
something vile, something that brought contamination
even just to see go between them. Did he and I look at
each other like that? It turned me sick even to think
on, even before—before that poor, poor man came in!
Heaven forgive me! Heaven strike those two in their
bad hearts! Oh, sir, did you look at her when she stared
back upon us, that woman? I suppose there was beauty
in her face; I suppose he who went with her thought her
handsome airs worth the cruelty and the blood and the
crime on his soul. But to me she was ugly, all ugly, with
the ugliness of her sin——”</p>

<p>She broke off, bit her quivering lip, and stared fixedly
before her; an expression of horror on her countenance
as if she still beheld the ugliness of which she spoke.</p>

<p>Mr. Bellairs straightened himself and snapped his
fingers again.</p>

<p>“Tall talk, my dear,” he began; and then broke off,
dropped his eyes under Sir Everard’s stern gaze, and
stood abashed. Then: “Perhaps you’re right,” he said
in an altered, strangled voice; and dashed from the
room as if driven.</p>

<p>Pamela started, glanced after him, and then wiped her
wet cheeks with the end of the baby’s shawl.</p>

<p>“Let him go,” she said.</p>

<p>“You’re a brave girl.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, sir! Only so grateful, so wonderfully saved,
so ashamed. Oh, this little creature against my breast—must
I not feel it—think of it—if I had had my foolish
way I should never have been worthy to hold such a
lovely, lovely little dear in my arms again.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Sir Everard insisted on lighting Pamela to her attic
chamber. She went up before him with a step so elastic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
in spite of the burden of the child in her arms, that she
had to wait for him on every landing; which she did
with a return of her bright amiability and even a flicker
of its former radiance in her smile. Each time she
halted she rocked the baby, swaying from foot to foot,
murmuring under her breath a crooning song which the
old man thought very sweet; so sweet indeed, that, with
a swing of memory’s pendulum it brought him back to
his own childhood’s days and the tender face of his mother,
long dead—a mother who had never been old like him.</p>

<p>On the threshold of her poor room they parted. She
spared him her right hand for a second from its motherly
caressing and patting of the child which she bore with
such ease on her left arm. He bowed over it as if it had
been his queen’s.</p>

<p>When he went down to the flaming hearth which justified
the landlord’s boast, he sat long by it.</p>

<p>He, who had hitherto lived apart in a world of books,
found his mind obsessed by the thought of the frightful
passions of humanity as they had this night played themselves
out before him.</p>

<p>The whole scene reproduced itself in his tired brain
with the colours of life; Lord Sanquhar’s sardonic, pale,
haughty face, the rich vividness, the unblessed allurement,
the cruel beauty of the unfaithful wife; the
Spaniard’s agony; the irredeemable tragedy of that
picture of the father with the child; then the dead face.</p>

<p>“Heaven strike their bad hearts!” had cried Pamela
in her honest revulsion. Could God ever forgive those
who had sent forth the soul of their victim so charged
with fury and despair that even death could bring no
peace to his brow?</p>

<p>And then he thought of Pamela’s face as he had last
seen it—pale, tear-stained, but with the old luminous
innocence. And, after all, he thought, there had come
good out of the evil.</p>

<p>“The providence of God is over us all,” he thought
with gratitude, as he rose stiffly to seek that feather bed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
where there was small likelihood of sleep that night for
him.</p>

<p>He heard the call of a coach horn beyond, in the night,
and immediately afterwards the mighty clatter of the
four sets of hoofs and the rush of the wheels in the streets.
He went to his window, opened it, and looked out.</p>

<p>The up coach from Dover, pausing only to drop a single
passenger. Stay, to take up a passenger, too. Sir
Everard recognised the swing of the shoulders, the tall,
alert frame, the indefinable swagger, even though muffled
in the many-caped travelling coat.</p>

<p>Young Bellairs was not going to Paris with a fair
companion!</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” said Sir Everard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In which Miss Pamela Pounce Demonstrates the<br>
Value of Virtue to her Family and her Friends</span></p>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">And</span> I’m sure, my dear,” said Mrs. Pounce, the tears
welling in her eyes as she gazed lovingly at her eldest
daughter, “’tis the golden girl you’ve been to us!”</p>

<p>“Ah, you wait, mother!” cried Pamela. “Just you
wait! If I don’t finish paying off that there mortgage
with the new spring fashions, call me Tabbishaw, that’s
all I say.”</p>

<p>The force of condemnation for vulgar stupidity could
go no further on Miss Pounce’s lips.</p>

<p>Farmer Pounce, seated before the kitchen fire, turned
his big, grizzled head to cast a glance no less affectionate
than his wife’s upon the good daughter.</p>

<p>“This time last year,” he said; then, in a ruminating
voice, “ah, ’twas a black look-out! As much as I could
do to squeeze the interest on the borrowed money and
the expenses of the new loan. And Sir Jasper, with his
eye on the farm this long while, turning the screw on me,
he and lawyer Grinder between them. Cruel hard terms
they made me, cruel hard, but there, ’twasn’t as if I
didn’t know their little game. Aye, aye, they were but
waiting, the both of them, to sell me up and get me out
of it all; the land my father’s father’s father called his
own.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pounce wept at the mere recollection. Where
would they have been, they and the little ones, but for
the golden girl?</p>

<p>Pamela winked away a bright tear of sympathy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Everything about this girl was bright; the spring of her
chestnut hair from her white forehead, which itself shone
as with a kind of luminosity, the glance of her full, shrewd
eyes, the smile that curved her lips. Oh, above all, it
was Pamela’s smile that was bright with the gaiety and
joy of life!</p>

<p>“Pish, you dears,” she said now, and covered up her
emotion with just one of those flashing smiles. “Don’t
be making too much of it. All those months I wasted at
old Tabbishaw’s didn’t I know in my spirit it would all
come right? Wasn’t I sure the whole time”—she
played with her capable fingers in the air—“that there
was a fortune in these hands once I could get them proper
to work? And I tell you now, without vanity—oh, I
ain’t got a mite of vanity about it, ’tis my gift, the way
pigs is father’s gift—give me a yard of ribbon, a feather,
and a bit of straw, and I’ll turn you out two guineas
before you can say ‘knife.’”</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure,” mused Mrs. Pounce, forgetting to
knead her scones. “And think of the Christmas dinner
we’ve had. A turkey fit for the Queen’s table, though
I says it as shouldn’t. And me having to sell every one
of my lovely birds last year and keep father on the salt
beef, Christmas and all! And there’s Susie, such a
picture in the bonnet you trimmed for her, at morning
service, that I’d never be surprised if Farmer Fleet’s son
were to come to the scratch to-night at Sir Jasper’s barn
dance, I shouldn’t indeed.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a white cambric, mother, and blue ribbons
ready for her,” said Pamela, smacking her lips with gusto,
“and a Shepherdess Dunstable. If that don’t settle
him! ’Tis the very thing, so simple and fresh, a sort of
daisy-gown, father and mother, that’ll start Master Tom
thinking o’ dairies and the clean linen and the white flour
in the bin; and, ‘What a modest, nice girl,’ he’ll say,
‘The very wife for a farmer. No nonsense of cheap finery.
Only what a maid could buy for herself and stitch at
home,’ he’ll think, poor innocent, and it’s the model for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the French Queen at Trianon, where she plays at milkmaid,
you’d never believe!”</p>

<p>“Mercy on us!” said Mrs. Pounce, with an uncomprehending
stare. “Frenchies be queer people, to be
sure.”</p>

<p>“And Jenny and Betty shall wear the sprigged muslin,”
pursued Pamela. “And my little pet, Peg, the robe-coat
I made her out of the odds and ends Madame Mirabel
gave me from her ladies’ counter.”</p>

<p>“And what will you wear yourself, my dear?” asked
the mother, cutting her rolled-out paste into neat
rounds.</p>

<p>“Is it me, mother?” Pamela hesitated. Then: “I
don’t mean to go,” says she.</p>

<p>“Not mean to go?” screamed the farmer’s wife,
blank disappointment writing itself on her good-humoured
countenance.</p>

<p>“Tut! tut!” cried the farmer, and wheeled himself
round in his chair.</p>

<p>The London girl coloured, and a shadow came over her
face.</p>

<p>“Some one’s got to stay at home and look after little
Tom,” said she stoutly, “and him but ten months old,
the poor fond lamb!”</p>

<p>She glanced at the wooden cradle to the left of the
hearth, where, under a patchwork quilt, a chubby miniature
reproduction of the farmer was lying, with fists
clenched in a determined fashion, as if he defied anyone
to rob him of his repose.</p>

<p>“Why, I never heard such nonsense!” Mrs. Pounce
gathered the cuttings of paste together and dabbed them
into a single lump with an irritable hand. “And who’s
minded little Tom, do ye think, all the hours, miss, that
I’ve got to be butter-making, plucking of geese, and
cutting up pig for the salting? Who but old Nance, my
love, who looked after yourself when you was no bigger
than the little ’un there?”</p>

<p>“She’s getting very old,” said Pamela. “I caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
her nodding yesterday with the Blessing on her lap, and
he as near as anything into the cinders. Besides, my
mind’s made up, and there’s no use your trying to unmake
it. I’ve my reasons, and that’s all there is to
it.”</p>

<p>“Why, Pam, why, lovey”—Mrs. Pounce had a grimace
like an infant about to cry—“you fair break my heart.
Why, ’twas all my thought, these days and days, how I’d
let neighbours see what a beauty my dear, good London
da’ter be, and as elegant as any lady!”</p>

<p>“If you’ve got a reason for disappointing your mother,
out with it, girl, so it’s a good ’un,” said Farmer Pounce,
with some sternness.</p>

<p>Pamela tossed her head. She was never one for
making mysteries.</p>

<p>“Well, father and mother, if you must know so particular,
wasn’t that Sir Jasper Standish as was driving
the high curricle away from Pitfold Church this morning?
The stout gentleman, with the kind of red eye, and it
rolling?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” grumbled the farmer, “the very man, my
dear, and a hard gentleman he be. And queer tales
there are about him. ’Tis a good thing he comes to
Standish Hall but seldom. Aye, aye, ’twas him driving
them bloods in the curricle. And a mort of fine ladies
and gentlemen in the barouche. They’ll be staying
Christmas, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” corroborated Mrs. Pounce. “A twenty-pound
jar of my best salt, and six turkeys, no less, not to speak
of the geese—aye, and a ham, cured in that very chamber
in the chimbley, child. But, dear, to be sure, was you
set against meeting Sir Jasper just for the seeing of him
step into his curricle?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t happen to note, mother, the gentleman
who stepped in after him?”</p>

<p>Farmer Pounce and his wife exchanged a scared look,
and then by common consent transferred it to their
daughter. There was silence, broken only by the cheerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
song of the kettle on its chain over the embers, and
the stertorous breathing of the infant farmer in the
cot.</p>

<p>Then, with a catch in her breath:</p>

<p>“Well, child?” ventured Mother Pounce.</p>

<p>Once more Pamela tossed her head. She was seated
at a corner of the kitchen table, needle, scissors, and
workbox at her elbow, and she turned and twisted the
lilac satin rosette in her hand.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said at last, without looking up. “I
don’t happen to want to meet him, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“How, my dear?” Mrs. Pounce shot a frightened
glance at her husband’s grim face, and another at her
daughter’s bright, bent head.</p>

<p>“Ain’t the young gentleman a friend of yours?” she
asked faintly.</p>

<p>Pamela snapped her thread.</p>

<p>“You do want to know a lot, don’t you, mother dear?
But there! There’s no reason why I shouldn’t tell you.
I’ve done nothing to be ashamed of. That young gentleman
has the good taste to admire me a mortal lot, but he
ain’t got the good taste, in my opinion, to admire me the
right way. He came after me to Canterbury, knowing
I was due here for my Christmas holiday, and I sent him
packing, and, thinks I, ’tis done now, once for all, and
we’ll be the best of friends at a distance. And you could
have knocked me down with a feather when I see his
black eye roaming round the church this morning. Encourage
him by going with you to-night? That would
never do, Pamela, my girl! says I to myself, and——”</p>

<p>“What dost mean by the right way, daughter?”
interrupted the farmer, who had been ruminating her
words, and not found them to his liking. The veins of
his forehead were swelled; the hand that gripped the
wooden arm of his chair shook.</p>

<p>“I mean the wrong way. Now, father, don’t you be
a-working yourself up. I can look after myself, and
ain’t that just what I’m doing? Mother, I vow your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
cap will beat the one I made for the Duchess of Queensberry
all to nothing. Now, won’t the children be pleased
when they find those cakes all piping hot, mother?
They ought to be in soon now—back from Rector’s.
I’d like to try the little gown on my poppet ere you put
her to rest to-night.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was the first party Sir Jasper had invited to Standish
Hall since the death of his wife, and lavish as was his
hospitality, the loss of that incomparable woman had
never been more painfully felt. A widower-forlornness
was over everything. Dusty, flowerless, unkempt the
parlours; discomfort, an open negligence of refined
detail, the lack of the controlling hand, in fine, was
sensible to all his guests.</p>

<p>The Christmas dinner was over, and the ladies had
retired. If you had cared to have examined the bottles
in rows on the floor, or the cut-glass decanters on the
table, you would have found that the company had drawn
considerably on Sir Jasper’s generous cellar, and had not
scrupled to mix very freely.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper and his youngest male guest, Mr. Jocelyn
Bellairs, were at the height of an argument, egged on
and applauded by good-natured Squire Upshott, and
that saturnine rake, Sir James Devlin, while Lawyer
Grinder, from Canterbury, leaned back, smiling grimly,
his grey fingers round his glass, his grey eyes acute, his
large ears pricked outside his scratch wig for any business
advantage the holiday dissipation should lay open.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! My dear fellow, the girl’s been three years
in Paris, I tell you! You’ll not have me believe she’s
better than her neighbours. Why, don’t I know all
about her? Isn’t her father squatting on a bit of land
that juts into my ring fence—’pon honour, like a fly in
a man’s honey—eh, Grinder? As handsome a slut as
I ever laid eyes on, if that’s the bouncer I saw at church
this morning. If you’re after her, lad, go in and win!
If not, step aside, and make room for your elders!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs took a draught from the beaker
in front of him, then cast rather a wild glance at his
host.</p>

<p>“You!” cried he. “You step in with Pamela Pounce!
My dear Sir Jasper, I do not intend to be uncivil, but the
idea is too droll!”</p>

<p>“How now? Is Miss so difficult? You know ’tis
but a milliner?”</p>

<p>“Ay, I know more of her, I dare swear, than you do.
Difficult? Well, Sir Jasper, you or anyone may try
their chances so far as I am concerned—I would not give
that for them”—snapping his fingers. “Pure waste!
When I tell you that I have failed——”</p>

<p>The unconscious cockscombry was greeted with a
shout of laughter.</p>

<p>“Hark to him!” cried old Upshott.</p>

<p>“Odds life!” jeered Sir Jasper. “You stimulate
me! So fastidious?”</p>

<p>“Nay!” Young Bellairs flung a fine black eye about
him. “So virtuous,” said he, his voice sinking quite
an octave deeper than its usual gay note.</p>

<p>There was another laugh; and then a silence; and
then Sir Jasper repeated drawling:</p>

<p>“So virtuous? It all depends what the virtue is—eh,
gentlemen? There’s prudence, now—they tell me
’tis much practised of the French.”</p>

<p>“What am I to take out of that, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why lad, you may take it that Miss knows her value.
With all due deference to your good looks, you might fail
where one like myself might succeed.”</p>

<p>“Meaning, Sir Jasper——?”</p>

<p>“Meaning, Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs, that little milliners,
especially if they’ve been in Paris, may have learnt to
have an eye to the main chance.”</p>

<p>There was again much and loud merriment. The
four other gentlemen looked at the one handsome youth
of the party as if it were agreeable to see his comb
cut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Gad, if there’s any betting going on it, I’ll back
Jasper,” said Sir James Devlin, with that cold smile of
his which seemed to blight where it rested. “But the
mischief’s in it, who’d take up the wager at such odds?
What? Sweet, penniless Romeo in the one scale, and
rich Sir Paris in the other, and Juliet a French milliner,
Pshaw!”</p>

<p>“Why then, Sir James,” cried Mr. Bellairs. “Romeo
is none so penniless but that he can back his own word.
I’m ready to wager Sir Jasper this moment as much as he
cares to risk that Miss Pamela Pounce—who is not
French, sir, but good Kentish stock—will send him to the
right-about, as she has sent—aye, though ’tis I say it—a
better man! That all his money-bags will not weigh
this nutshell”—he crushed one under his clenched
hand on the mahogany as he spoke—“against her
virtue.”</p>

<p>Sir Jasper grew red in the face; his eyes protruded,
his veins swelled.</p>

<p>“Why, done with you, you poor innocent——”</p>

<p>“Stay, stay,” intervened Sir James. “If there’s to
be betting, let’s do it proper, a’ Heaven’s name! <i>In
primo</i>, what is the wager to be?”</p>

<p>Sir Jasper and Bellairs spoke together:</p>

<p>“That pretty Pounce will pounce fast enough if it is
made worth her while,” cried Sir Jasper, with a guffaw.
And:</p>

<p>“That Sir Jasper has about as much chance of Miss
Pamela Pounce’s favour as of the Princess Royal’s,”
asserted Bellairs.</p>

<p>“Now, tut, tut!” Sir James Devlin shook his head
and clacked his tongue. “If I’m to draw up your wager,
gentlemen, you must, if you please, be a trifle less slipshod.
You can’t bet on a pun, Sir Jasper, nor you on a high-falutin’
comparison to royal ladies, young man. You’ve
got to bet on facts, my lads. Say, that a week from to-day
we find the young person agreeably installed under
the protection of our host here, in—better say London—eh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Jasper? Might be a bit awkward, too close to Miss’s
family, what? Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs here to be given
ocular proof that circumstances alter cases. Let your
charmer ask him to tea in her new abode this day
week.”</p>

<p>“Carry her off, carry her off, good old style. Tally-ho!”
cried the tipsy squire.</p>

<p>“Capital idea!” Mr. Grinder shook with amusement.
“Run away with her! Carry her off, and keep
her from the hats and feathers, Sir Jasper, and I’ll see
that you get Little Pitfold at long last. We’ll foreclose
for the rest of the mortgage. Zounds, we will! Drat
that girl! She’s been paying off at an uncommon quick
rate. Took my breath away, she did. We had to give
old Pounce a couple of years for the look of the thing,
you remember—never dreaming—But there! Time will
be up next Lady Day, and”—he broke into dry chuckling—“if
you carry off the girl you’ll win your wager,
and get your land into the bargain. Kill two birds with
one stone.”</p>

<p>Jocelyn Bellairs lay back in his seat with arms folded,
and a scornful smile on his countenance. He did not
care what conditions were imposed, and the higher the
stake the better for him. He was so sure of the result.</p>

<p>Sir James Devlin had drawn out his tablets.</p>

<p>“The wager’s plain enough now,” quoth he. “Sir
Jasper Standish wagers Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs that the
girl, Pamela Pounce, will give him a dish of tea this day
week, at an address hereafter to be determined, the said
Pamela Pounce being then established under the protection
of the said Jasper Standish. What are the
stakes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, make it worth while!” eagerly cried Bellairs.</p>

<p>Devlin gave him a keen side-glance.</p>

<p>“’Tis scarce usual to make the stakes higher than you
can meet, Mr. Bellairs.”</p>

<p>The young man flushed darkly. But before he could
reply:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“Odds my life,” exclaimed Sir Jasper. “Let’s
make it worth while! What say you to a thousand
guineas?”</p>

<p>“Done!” cried Jocelyn eagerly. Then he added:
“I’d like to make a stipulation. If Sir James loses, let
him remit the rest of that mortgage first, whatever it is.
I’ll be content with the residue.”</p>

<p>“’Pon my word, sir, that’s a strange proposal,” said
Sir Jasper, staring with an air which gave him an odd
resemblance to an incensed bull.</p>

<p>“You can cry off the whole bet, if you’re afraid of it,”
taunted his guest.</p>

<p>“Foh!” said Mr. Grinder. “’Tis but a matter of a
hundred and eighty-nine pounds, when all is said and
done. Never niggle at that, Sir Jasper. Go in, and
win! ’Pon me soul!” cried the old sinner, rubbing his
hands, “I’d sleep better in my grave if I thought the
Standish estate had got Pitfold at last.”</p>

<p>“The stakes to be a thousand guineas,” murmured
Devlin as he wrote, “out of which Sir Jasper remits the
rest of Farmer Pounce’s mortgage, one hundred and
eighty-nine pounds and hands the residue eight hundred
and eleven, plus the shillings for the guineas, to Mr.
Jocelyn Bellairs. Any backers? Fifty guineas on
Jasper. Who’ll take me?”</p>

<p>Squire Upshott was too far gone, and Lawyer Grinder
shook his head, so Sir James had to content himself with
jotting down: “No backers.”</p>

<p>“Why, zounds!” exclaimed Sir Jasper, after he had
ruminated a while. “It seems that more hangs on this
betting to-night than the virtue of Miss, after all. What?
The farm that we Standishes from grandfather down
have vainly been trying to get hold of. That’s a fine
idea of yours, Grinder, odds my life, it is! A thousand
guineas besides, and as fine an armful—hark ye, Devlin,
did ye notice her this morning in church, as neat as a
chestnut filly? Foh! There’s blood in her, sir, there’s
blood in her, or I’m no judge——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>He broke off. ’Twas a dashed superior smile on young
puppy’s face. What made the fellow so cocksure, in the
name of all that was sly? A sudden thought struck him.</p>

<p>“Look you here, Master Bellairs,” cried he, with a
muffled roar. “No collusion! No putting your head
and Miss Pounce’s together to do me out of a thousand
guineas! Eh, Devlin? Eh, Grinder? No blanked
tricks!”</p>

<p>Jocelyn’s nostrils quivered scornfully.</p>

<p>“I give you my word of honour, Sir Jasper,” said he,
“to have no communication in private with the young
lady till your week is out.”</p>

<p>“Come, come!” said Sir James. “Split me, Jasper,
we’re all gentlemen here!”</p>

<p>The smile on the face of Mr. Bellairs became accentuated.</p>

<p>“I’m ready to give Sir Jasper any guarantee,” said
he.</p>

<p>“Deuce take him! He’s like a fellow with a card up
his sleeve!” thought Sir Jasper. “Word of honour, or
no word of honour, I’ll make Devlin keep watch for
me.”</p>

<p>When they went upstairs to the splendid, neglected
drawing-room where Lady Barbara Flyte, her niece, Miss
Lesbia Ogle, and Mrs. Colonel Dashwood were waiting
to pour out tea for them, Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs showed
himself in high spirits.</p>

<p>“Ah, Pamela, my girl!” cried he to himself, “that
was an angry look you cast at me across your prayer-book
this morning, a monstrous, unpeaceful kind of look
to a man of good will; but if this day’s work has not
wiped out old scores—A ‘filly,’ he called you. Aye,
you’ll come over the fence as clean as a bird. I’ve no
fear of you, my splendid girl, and you’ll be kinder to me,
I dare swear, when next we meet; but that won’t be this
day week, at any lodging paid for by Sir Jasper.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Why, la, Sir Jasper, what a merry tune!” And
“Oh, Sir Jasper, what a strange, pretty place!” And,
“Why, Sir Jasper, ’tis the most Christmas sight I’ve
ever beheld!” And, “Pray, pray, Sir Jasper, don’t ask
me to trip it with your country bumpkins, for I vow and
protest I could never pick up those vulgar steps!”
And, “Oh, Aunt Bab, do but look at the pink roses in
Goody’s cap!” And, “Oh, Miss Ogle, you’re nowhere,
I declare, beside Miss in feathers yonder, plucked from
the old turkey before mother put it in the pot.” “You’re
too droll, Mrs. Dashwood!” “Do you think, Sir
Jasper, the buck in the top-boots would have me for his
partner if I simpered ever so sweet upon him?”</p>

<p>Sir Jasper, moving in this fire of chatter, a lady on
each arm and Miss Lesbia Ogle hanging on his coat-tails,
appeared at the barn-door when he believed his guests
to be assembled. The merry tune to which Lady Bab
had alluded fell silent at his approach; there were curtseys
and dips and bows on every side, while the three
fiddlers mopped their streaming faces and, rising as one
man from the wooden bench on which they had been
seated in a row, duly ducked their shock heads to their
patron.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper gave condescending smiles and short, indifferent
nods right and left, the while his eyes roamed,
seeking, this way and that. Here was old Mother Pounce,
right enough, as large as one of her own feather beds, in
a lace cap, if you please, mighty genteel, with lavender
knots. And Farmer Pounce in his red waistcoat; confound
the fellow, with his air of independence! Aye, was
there not a sort of triumph about him? Don’t cry till
you’re out of the wood, Mr. Yeoman! And split him,
what a row of young Pounces—a fine healthy litter!
And, ’pon honour, a monstrous pretty little chit in
white muslin with a straw hat! Pshaw! He had no
time to waste on silly seventeen. Where was their
agreeable bone of contention; where was the handsome
Pamela?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“How, now, yeoman, where is your elder daughter?”</p>

<p>“At home, Sir Jasper,” answered the father, with the
brevity that declines discussion.</p>

<p>“Sure, Sir Jasper,” put in Mrs. Pounce, conciliatingly.
“My daughter was vastly obleeged, but she was a trifle
fatigued this evening.”</p>

<p>“She would stay and look after our Tom,” piped
Susie.</p>

<p>“She preferred not to come, sir,” said Yeoman Pounce,
frowning.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper’s brow had likewise gathered thunder-clouds.
His eyes rolled inward. One excuse contradicted another;
the farmer’s insolence voiced the truth. And
Master Jocelyn Bellairs, who had not accompanied his
host to the dance, because forsooth, it might be difficult
for him to keep his honourable pledge—Master Jocelyn
Bellairs, who had announced his intention of taking a
pleasure stroll this freezing Christmas night—Master
Jocelyn Bellairs, whose very presence at Standish Hall
demanded explanation; who was practically a self-invited
visitor, where was he? Pshaw, did they take
him for a fool? Was he to be mocked in his own house
and jockeyed by his own guest? Zounds! The whole
plot was clear in a minute. A plot it was; no wonder
Mr. Bellairs had that insufferable air of certainty. He and
his lady-love would soon be laughing over the thought of
how they had swindled him of a thousand guineas. And
what a spending time they would have together!</p>

<p>If the revelation came swift as lightning to Sir Jasper,
no less swiftly did he make up his mind for action.</p>

<p>It was a three-mile walk to Pitfold Farm. He would
have out his curricle, and his bloods, and be beforehand
with Bellairs.</p>

<p>Some ten minutes later he was bowling along the frozen
road at the highest speed of his roughed horses, an
astounded groom beside him. Purpose was setting in
his mind as hard as the ice in the ditches. There was no
time like the present. He had a slippery pair of young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
rascals to deal with. If he was to win his wager he must
carry off the girl this very night.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He laid his plans with a wiliness which is not infrequently
a characteristic of gross natures. Conscious
in himself of a fine capacity for evil, such as he will be
suspicious of every one and everything; look for treachery
from his most trusted friend, and infidelity in the wife
of his bosom.</p>

<p>He dismounted at the farmyard gate, and bade Job
Stallion, the groom, drive in alone and announce that
Sir Jasper Standish had sent the curricle for Miss Pounce,
as it was her father and mother’s pleasure she should
come to the dance.</p>

<p>The ruse succeeded with a facility beyond his expectations.
Pamela had been finding the lonely evening
disconsolate enough. Baby Tom slept, while old Nance
displayed uncommon wakefulness. The time was heavy
on Pamela’s hands, and to while it away she had had the
happy thought of trying on the pretty garments which
she had prepared before Mr. Bellairs’ appearance in
church had made a call upon her prudence.</p>

<p>Now the reaction which so often follows self-sacrifice
had set in. She was beginning to call herself a fool, and
to regret her excessive discretion. Thus when old Nance
laboured, panting, to the attic chamber, and supplemented
Job’s message with: “You’d never think of
saying nay now, Pam, my dear. Ain’t it Providence
you should just have been fitting on? And, oh, to be
sure, was there ever so pure lovely a gown? You’ll be
the belle o’ the ball, my dearie, that you will, and easy!”</p>

<p>Pamela never hesitated at all. She caught her travelling-cloak
off the peg, and lifted her best feathered hat
from its bandbox—how could a milliner resist such an
opportunity?—pinned it on her auburn curls, cast herself
headlong down the stairs, out through the farm kitchen
like a whirlwind, and laughing, swung herself up on the
curricle beside the grinning Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>She was rather taken aback when this latter halted
outside the farmyard gate, and a portly figure appeared
from the shadow of the oak tree. Hat in hand, Sir
Jasper pleasantly saluted her.</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Pounce, this is capital. Your father and
mother vowed you’d never come, but I said I was sure
so good a daughter would be obedient to her parents.
Nevertheless”—he was climbing up beside her in the
high seat, while Job shut the gates behind them—“I was
ready, you see, to exercise a neighbour’s persuasion,
should you persist in your cruel resolve. The ball would
be nothing without you, ’pon honour. There are half a
dozen fine young bucks with faces as long as my whip-handle
already.”</p>

<p>By this time Job was up on the back seat, and his
master started the chestnuts at a pace that only his own
pride and temper would have urged upon them.</p>

<p>“Oh, la!” cried Miss Pounce, and made a clutch for
her hat. She drew the pure keen air into her lungs, felt
the wind of their passage blow with the most delicious
invigoration against her face. “Oh, la! Was there
ever anything so beautiful? ’Tis the first time I have
driven by moonlight. ’Tis the first time I have ever
driven in a curricle! Oh, ’tis like flying, Sir Jasper!
Oh, what a night! I vow I feel like a bird!”</p>

<p>The moonlight flooded the road, hedges and trees
sparkled and shimmered white as diamonds. The sky
was one mighty sapphire, darkly, wonderfully blue.
The stars, fainting in the moonlight, looked like the
thousand facets of a jewel.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Pamela again, “I’ll make a head out of it
for the opera, I will indeed! Sapphire blue ribbands
and frosted silver feathers. ’Tis an inspiration.”</p>

<p>This gave Sir Jasper his opening.</p>

<p>“Why,” said he, “’tis a monstrous pity such a monstrous
fine girl as you should have to work for her living.
The moment I set eyes on you this morning, said I to
myself——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Pamela interrupted:</p>

<p>“Keep your pity and your compliments, sir. They’re
wasted on me.”</p>

<p>“Why, how now, I like your spirit. I vow, my dear,
’tis you are wasted on such a life.”</p>

<p>“What if I like my work, sir?”</p>

<p>“You were born to wear ’em—the fine hats—not to
make ’em. You were born to be a lady, that’s what I
said to myself the moment I clapped eyes on you this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Foh! I know ’tis gentlemen’s way to start this kind
of silly talk whenever they get with a poor girl, but I
assure you, sir, I’ve no relish for it. And as for my being
a lady, I’ve seen too much of gentlefolk. I wouldn’t
thank the Lord to ha’ made me one.”</p>

<p>She spoke with her head up and a straight back.</p>

<p>“’Tis but gentlemen’s way,” she repeated to herself;
“but I’ll let him see he’ll have to respect me, lady or no
lady.”</p>

<p>She gripped the rail of the curricle, not to give herself
courage—for she had no thought there was anything to
fear—but to brace herself the better against any further
presumption. She was quite unprepared, therefore,
when he turned his bloods away from the road leading
to Standish Hall, and, with a flourish of the whip,
sent them helter-skelter up the hill on the London
causeway.</p>

<p>The cry she gave was one more of anger than of fear.
A solitary pedestrian, coming at a swinging pace along
the road which led from Sir Jasper’s residence, heard it,
and beheld the curricle as it topped the hill, fantastically
silhouetted in black against the moonlit sky. He gave
an answering shout, and started running. But he had
as much chance of overtaking the gig as if it had been
a bird on the flight. He gave up, panting, after a yard
or two, stamped his foot, shook his fist at the radiant
sky, and started running again in the opposite direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Where are you taking me to?”</p>

<p>Sir Jasper’s teeth and his eyeballs flashed horribly in
the silver light as he smiled upon Pamela.</p>

<p>“You’ll be uncommon grateful to me one day, my
pretty little milliner.”</p>

<p>“Good Heaven, what do you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“I dare swear you ain’t so far from being grateful now.
Oh, aye! ’Tis the regular thing to set up a hullaballoo,
but I’m not to be taken in by any tushery, and so I tell
you! You may scream till you’re blue, there ain’t a soul
on the roads to hear you, and as for kicking, ’tain’t easy
on a curricle, so, like a girl of sense let’s pretend you’ve
had your vapours, and you and I will have a glorious time
together. Why, who was talking of silver feathers?
’Tis golden chains I’ll give you, my splendid child; aye,
and a pearl each for your pretty ears—I can’t see ’em
under your hat, but I dare swear they’re pretty like the
rest—and maybe a diamond brooch for your kerchief.
And you shall have a house of your own and a pair of fine
London maids to wait on you, and I’ll take you about,
my dear, and you will have naught to do in the world
but enjoy yourself.”</p>

<p>She listened in dead silence till he had finished, and then
without condescending to reply to him, turned her head
over her shoulder, and hailed the groom.</p>

<p>“Job Stallion, Job Stallion,” she said, “your father was
reared on my father’s land. Will you see a Kentish girl
carried away to perdition against her will, and not lift
a finger to save her?”</p>

<p>“Job Stallion,” said Sir Jasper, snatching a pistol from
the seat beside him, “if you unfold your arms you’re a
dead man.”</p>

<p>Then Sir Jasper and the yeoman’s daughter stared into
each other’s eyes, each drawing long, fierce breaths
through dilated nostrils. Suddenly he laughed and
dropped the pistol back into its holster. Again he sent
his whip circling. The horses broke into a canter on the
downward slope, the light-hung vehicle swaying and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
leaping behind them. The very intensity of their speed
saved them from stumbling.</p>

<p>At length Pamela said in a low voice:</p>

<p>“At least I have a right to know where you are taking
me.”</p>

<p>“Did I not tell you? To London.”</p>

<p>“You do not think I am so simple as to believe you can
drive to London with these horses to-night?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course not. We’ll stop at Ashford, and get a
chaise and four of the best posters money can hire. We’ll
be in London to-night, never fear. Hark, there’s nine
of the clock striking from Catterford Hill.”</p>

<p>He pointed with his whip. Pamela saw the square
tower of the little church silver and black against the sky.
A lump rose in her throat. For the first and only time
that night a burst of hysterical weeping threatened to
overwhelm her.</p>

<p>“I’m lost,” she said to herself, “if I don’t keep brave.
If I don’t keep my head, I’m lost.”</p>

<p>No strong soul ever cries vainly on courage. The
anguish passed, her spirit rose.</p>

<p>“Sir Jasper Standish,” said she, “why are you running
away with me? Tell me that.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you believe I want to make a lady of
you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, the mere sight of that handsome face of
yours this morning has made me mad in love with you.
Will you believe that?”</p>

<p>“Neither the one nor the other, sir. You see,” she
went on, “I am not kicking nor screaming, I am in your
power, and I can’t help myself. I think you’d find it
better for yourself, sir, and better for me, if you’d tell me
the truth.”</p>

<p>Her quiet tone, the perfect composure of her face, very
pale and lovely in the moonlight as she turned it upon
him, struck some faint spark of generosity.</p>

<p>“By Heaven!” said he admiringly. “You’re a well-plucked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
one. The truth you want. Split me, ’tis all
true! But you’re right, there’s yet another reason.
I want to win a wager, my little darling!”</p>

<p>“What wager, sir?”</p>

<p>“You.” He grinned at her. “That spark of yours—he
is a spark of yours, ain’t he?—that fine young fellow,
Jocelyn Bellairs, he wagered you were too virtuous for a
man to have a chance with. But I wagered him you
wasn’t. Come now, you’re a good-hearted piece. Help
me to win my wager, and I’ll make it worth your
while.”</p>

<p>Pamela reflected profoundly. Then she gave a little
laugh.</p>

<p>“Why, Sir Jasper!” she exclaimed. “What sad,
wild creatures you gentlemen are! It comes to this,
then. I’ve got to make the best of a bad job.” Then she
swallowed hard, and said, with a still more sprightly air,
“You’ll give me a bit of supper at Ashford, I suppose,
for I’m mortal hungry.”</p>

<p>He broke into hoarse laughter, and cried again that, by
Heaven, she was a well-plucked one, and they’d get on
first class; that she should have the finest supper the
Bear Inn could afford. If she’d stand by him, by Jingo,
he’d stand by her. There wasn’t a gentleman in England
who’d be such a friend to the woman who trusted him
as he would be to her.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Ashford, she demanded, with a
sudden air of command, which became her, he thought,
mightily, and tickled his already high good humour to
positive hilarity, that she should be brought to a sitting-room
and partake of the meal in privacy while the post-chaise
was being got ready.</p>

<p>“And,” quoth she, “let it be champagne, Sir Jasper,
since”—she gave him a wide, taunting smile—“’tis to
be made worth my while.”</p>

<p>He flung an arm about her the moment the waiter had
withdrawn; she freed herself with a vigorous thrust, but
as she did so, she laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Nay, drink your sillery, sir. Aye, pour me a glass.
Oh, aye, I’ll drink any toast you like. Have you not said
it yourself? I’m the best-natured girl in the world—so
long as you keep your place, sir. Why, ’tis the finest
pigeon-pie I’ve tasted since Paris. You know I was in
Paris, Sir Jasper?”</p>

<p>Sir Jasper chuckled, winking at her.</p>

<p>Her fingers clenched round her knife, the while her
smile would not have misbefitted the lips of a Bacchante.</p>

<p>“And will you bring me to the opera, Sir Jasper? Oh,
and to Ranelagh? Oh, to think of me going to Ranelagh
on a gentleman’s arm, like a lady!”</p>

<p>He was enraptured. He tossed the remainder of his
tumbler down, and filled himself a third, emptying the
bottle. He had almost forgotten the wager in the
intoxication of his personal triumph. Dash it! It had
not taken him long to cut out young Bellairs. What a
demnition handsome piece she was. There wasn’t one of
those raffish ladies he had left behind him at Standish
Hall could hold a candle to her. And odds his life!
What a pair of eyes she had, and what teeth, and what
a skin!</p>

<p>Suddenly she dropped her knife and fork.</p>

<p>“Sir Jasper,” said she, with an air of great gravity,
“I’ll not go a step farther with you unless you do something
for me.”</p>

<p>“Name it, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, send Job back with a letter to my parents.
And ’twill be the best for yourself, I can tell you, as
matters stand. My father wouldn’t let the king rob him
of his daughter without a fight.”</p>

<p>He stood staring at her doubtfully, his wide nostrils
scenting mischief like an irritated bull; she went on very
quickly, “I’ll not go a step farther with you unless you
do. Give me your tablets—gentlemen always carry
them, I know. You shall see for yourself what I
write.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“<i>Dear Father—don’t be alarmed, I’m going with Sir
Jasper for a wager. ’Tis a mere joke. He’s too grand
a gentleman to let harm come to me out of it.—Your
loving daughter, Pam.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>She read it to him. He went over it himself, then once
more tried to catch her to him, vowing she was as clever
as she was handsome.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, nay!” She was the most imperative,
tantalising creature possible to imagine. “Now, Sir
Jasper, run and give this to Job yourself. Stay, put a
guinea with it, to make the lad eager. Tell him to ride,
ride, ride, hell for leather! Isn’t that what you gentlemen
say? Hell for leather,” she repeated, laughing, as she
hustled him from the room. “Don’t come back to me
till you’ve seen him start.”</p>

<p>He went. That third bumper of champagne on the
head of so many potations earlier in the day, after the
long, cold drive, had fairly stupefied him. He went,
because her strong will drove him, without attempting
to analyse her motive. For the moment his suspicious
brain was lulled to a kind of imbecile complacence. He
went pounding forth. As soon as the sound of his heavy
steps died away on the wooden boards, Pamela was out
of the room like a dart.</p>

<p>She had seen the dark pit of the back stairs gape on the
passage as they had passed along to the sitting-room.
She was down it now, as sure-footed as if it had been lit
up. In another moment, past a pair of staring kitchen
sluts and a tapman, she was out in the back yard and
running along the village street.</p>

<p>She always declared afterwards that she had been as
one guided. She did not pause to reconnoitre or hesitate
at a turning. Fleet and light as a shadow, she raced
through the alleys of the little town, deserted this Christmas
night, till she came to a point on the main road
which she knew Job Stallion must pass on his homeward
way, and then she hid herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>She had not very long to wait before the beat of horses’
hoofs resounded on the frozen ground. Hell for leather,
indeed! ’Twas the most egregious jog-trot that ever
took lazy groom and unwilling horse from warm quarters
on a Christmas night!</p>

<p>Job Stallion let fly a terrified oath as Pamela rose out of
the ditch and laid a hand upon his bridle. He was
scarcely less alarmed when he discovered that he had to
do with neither wraith nor highwaywoman, but with his
master’s prize. She cut short his “darsents” and his
whimpering expostulations very sternly.</p>

<p>“I am going to ride pillion behind you, Job Stallion,
and you must whip up that fat brute of a post-horse to
something of a canter, for you’ve got to carry me back
home before Sir Jasper can overtake us. Thank your
stars, my lad,” she went on, “that the Lord has given
you a chance of redeeming the night’s work, for I tell you
it would have gone hard with any who had a hand in it.
Men have been hanged for less!”</p>

<p>She kept him busy with whip and spur till the old grey
mare wheezed and bucketed along the road at a pace
astonishing for her years and size.</p>

<p>It was somewhere midway between Ashford and
Pitfold that they crossed Mr. Bellairs riding towards them
on his own rakish chestnut as if for a race. If Pamela’s
heart beat high at sight of him she did not avow her
pride and pleasure even to herself; if her bright, clear
heat of anger and triumphant determination gave place
to tender, womanly emotions, she betrayed no sign of
them. She postponed explanations, and issued instructions
to Mr. Bellairs as to Job Stallion in the accents
of one who means they shall be carried out.</p>

<p>“You will kindly ride a hundred paces behind me,
Mr. Bellairs. I have no notion of having my name
mixed up with yours or Sir Jasper’s this night. As for
you, Job, hand me over that tablet. You can keep the
guinea for yourself. And you will drop me, if you please,
in the courtyard at Standish Hall, for ’tis not too late to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
join the dancers in the barn. And I mean there shall
be no talk on this night’s work, if I can help it.</p>

<p>“If you breathe a word, Job Stallion, you’ll wish you
never were born, or my father’s name not Jeremy Pounce!
And as for you, Mr. Bellairs, sir, you’ve won your wager—yes,
I know all about it—so you owe me a good turn, I
think, and all I ask for is silence, silence! My father’s
a violent man, and it does no woman’s name any good—no,
not even a poor milliner’s—to be made such sport
of as mine betwixt you two gentlemen to-night. As for
Sir Jasper, I warrant he’ll hold his tongue. He don’t
cut so fine a figure!”</p>

<p>And so it ended. Pamela went to the barn dance,
after all, and danced in vast condescension with several
agreeable young farmers. Jocelyn Bellairs got the
rector to introduce him to Mrs. Pounce, and sitting beside
that lady, made himself so agreeable that she was, as
she expressed it, quite in a twitter. Mindful of his word
passed to Sir Jasper, he did not again approach Pamela,
but the gaze with which he followed her about the long
room was eloquent enough.</p>

<p>When the little Pounces had nearly yawned themselves
off the benches, and Pamela’s poppet, Peg, had gone to
sleep outright, her curly head on her mother’s ample lap,
it was the elegant young gentleman who conducted Mrs.
Pounce to the waiting farm cart, with as much courtesy
as if he were leading a duchess to her barouche. The
moon was set. The courtyard was fitfully illumined by
torches thrust into clamps in the wall, and by the shifting
rays of the lanterns carried by the revellers.</p>

<p>As Pamela, standing by the cart, lifted Peg up to her
mother’s extended arms, while Mr. Bellairs obligingly
held the lantern, Sir Jasper’s curricle wheeled slowly
into the yard drawn by a pair of fairly exhausted
thoroughbreds. Without stirring from his high seat,
the reins slipping from his hands, Sir Jasper stared at
the picture painted on the night as at some spectral
vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Why, here’s Sir Jasper!” cried an obsequious voice.
“Three cheers for Sir Jasper, lads!”</p>

<p>Perhaps because his appearance had been as unexpected
as his disappearance, perhaps because the sight of his
dreadful face of wrath, flamingly illumined by the red
glare of a torch was enough to choke off any demonstration,
perhaps because he was too unpopular a landlord even
for so many glasses of negus and so many mince-pies to
counterbalance—however it may have been, there was
but a poor response; a faint cry, that rose and quavered
away. It was almost more deadly in its effect than an
execration. Sir Jasper rolled a bloodshot eye upon his
tenants and neighbours.</p>

<p>“Blast you all!” he cried huskily, let himself drop
from his seat, and reeled towards the house.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On New Year’s day Pamela returned to London, and,
on the day after, a summons to Yeoman Pounce to attend
at Mr. Grinder’s office in Canterbury caused some perturbation
to the inmates of Little Pitfold. But when he
returned he brought astounding intelligence.</p>

<p>“You’ll never believe it, wife!” he cried from the
threshold, “but the mortgage is paid off! Buss me,
mother, we’re free of our own again!”</p>

<p>“Oh, ’tis our Pam! ’Tis that best of children! Oh,
the surprise, father! Oh, the slyness of it, never telling
us a word! Oh, was there ever so good a girl?”</p>

<p>“Lawyer Grinder,” said the farmer, letting himself
drop heavily in a chair, “kept a close mouth. He wasn’t
at liberty, those were his words, to say who it was as had
paid it off. ‘But paid off it is, and that’s enough for you,
farmer,’ says he. ‘I reckon I know whom I’m beholden
to,’ I says, ‘and I’ll tell you plain, lawyer,’ says I,
‘I’m not a man as ’ud be beholden without it was to one
who, so to speak, be but paying back what’s due to a
parent.’ At that he smiles on the wrong side of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
mouth, after his fashion, wife, none best pleased, I can
tell you. As for Sir Jasper—well, he won’t get hold o’
Little Pitfold nohow now!”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Pounce wrote to Pamela in London the
letter was very full of blessings on a good daughter.</p>

<p>“And your father is so out of himself with joy, my dear,
’tis a new lease of life.”</p>

<p>And Pamela smiled as she read. Her lover, now very
respectful, though by no means less ardent, had told her
the story of the wager. Who was to say, after all, that
she had not paid off the mortgage? As for the rest, she
knew when to speak and when to be silent.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In which my Lady Kilcroney Strikes a Match and<br>
Miss Pounce Throws Cold Water on it</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> late Lady Standish was one of my Lady Kilcroney’s
earliest friends.</p>

<p>When Kitty first burst upon society in the select
precincts of Bath—then the fabulously rich, unpardonably
pretty, delightful, audacious, amazing little Widow
Bellairs—Julia Standish was scarce a three weeks’ bride.</p>

<p>From the very beginning Kitty’s endeavour had been
to insert some backbone into the lovely but invertebrate
Julia, and once, in despair, she had summed up the
situation by exclaiming: “That ’twas like trying to
mould too soft a jelly: the moment you thought you had
her into shape, she was deliquescent again.”</p>

<p>Therefore, though the connection was long and close;
though Kitty, whether as Mistress Bellairs or my Lady
Kilcroney, counted no party complete without her Julia;
though, when in town together, scarce a day could pass
upon which Julia, driven by the stress of some overwhelming
emotional crisis, did not fling herself, weeping,
upon Kitty’s breast, it could not be said that my Lady
Kilcroney was very ardently attached to Lady Standish,
or that her death, sad and premature as it was, plunged
her in any depth of sorrow.</p>

<p>The truth was that Julia Standish, elegant and virtuous,
fair to look on and fond of feeling, belonged to the class
that wear out the affections by over-usage. The stuff
of Kitty’s sturdy good comradeship had been worn so
uncommonly thin, that at the time of Julia’s lamented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
death scarcely enough had been left between them to
make a darn worth while.</p>

<p>Kitty liked life in a strong brew, and Lady Standish
wept into her cup so persistently that there was nothing
left but salt water.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the news of the irreparable event
reached her, my Lady, being the best-hearted little woman
in the world, wept herself for quite three minutes, and
then, dispatching her Lord to see what service he could
be to poor Sir Jasper, ordered her sedan and had herself
deposited at Madame Mirabel’s in Bond Street, to order
a black bonnet and mourning mantle for the funeral.</p>

<p>My Lord had set out on his melancholy errand with a
dutiful concealment of its intense distastefulness.</p>

<p>He thought Jasper’s case the most confounded dreadful
a man could be placed in, and shrank, with all his Irish
softness, from the spectacle of a woe beyond his consolation.</p>

<p>He found matters even more tragic than he anticipated.
The last word Sir Jasper’s incomparable Julia murmured
to him, as, her hand in his, she left him for a better world,
was to remind him of his promise never to replace her.
This pledge had been exacted many times during the
seven years of their existence together, but never more
solemnly than in the hours that had preceded her demise.</p>

<p>From the moment of her seizure—spasms on the lungs—to
that last breath, Sir Jasper had been in unremitting
attendance. Every physician of note had been summoned
to her bedside; but, in spite of all the resources of science,
bloodings, blisters and cuppings, pills and potions, poor
Julia Standish persisted in succumbing. He was the
most afflicted of widowers! She had been the pearl of
wives. No woman could ever compare with her in the
whole world again. He was a blasted man. Console
himself! he roared. That angel, that departed saint
need have put him to no promise. She might sleep in
peace; her Jasper was henceforth naught but a solitary
mourner. What was left him, indeed, but to live for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
his little ones, those five pledges of their mutual affection;
to rear them worthy of such a mother, and, his task
accomplished, take his broken heart to lie beside her in
the grave? “For I will be buried with my Julia,” he
cried upon each fresh gush of tears.</p>

<p>“Faith,” said Lord Kilcroney to his Kitty, describing
the scene to her when they met again, “she’s dropt her
mantle upon him with a vengeance. Wasn’t it the
watering-pot you used to call her, me darling? The
poor lady. He caught me by the neck a while ago, and
troth he soaked me to the skin. ‘She was the most
elegant woman!’ cries he. ‘She was that, me lad,’
says I. ‘And the most virtuous!’ cries he, with another
gulp. ‘Aye, that she was,’ cries I. And sure, Kitty,
if ever a poor soul made virtue tedious and dismal——”</p>

<p>“Hush, hush!” my Lady Kilcroney interrupted.
“Speak no ill of the dead, sir. Poor Julia, she was a
fond, foolish creature, but she was an old friend, and,
’pon honour. Denis, I’m crying for her myself. ’Tis
but fitting indeed, that Sir Jasper, who was a sad, bad
husband, my love, and would have given any woman
red eyes, should mourn her now.”</p>

<p>“’Tis the frantickest widower I ever met. Mourn,
quotha! ‘How shall I survive?’ is all his cry, and to
see him going on that way, you’d scarce give him a
sennight.”</p>

<p>“Psha!” said Kitty. “Such frantick fits never last.
I give him a sennight, my Lord, to—to dry his eyes and
look about for number two.”</p>

<p>“’Pon me honour, Kitty, you’re out of it! Didn’t
she extract a promise from him, the dying angel, that
he’d never look at woman again, and as for marriage——”</p>

<p>“And if that isn’t Julia all over!” cried Kitty indignantly.
“And he with five children! A man of Sir
Jasper’s temperament! Tush! Pooh! And were I
on my death-bed, Denis, ’twould be the last of my wishes
to lay such a monstrous bit of nonsense on your spirits.
Why, ’twould be but tempting you to perjury. Yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
you—or any other man. ‘Look out for a well-bred
creature, pray,’ I would say, ‘and a healthy, that she
be kind to our little Denis, and pick her sensible, for the
Lord’s sake.’ Now, Sir Jasper, mark my words ... I
give him a week to bellow, and, after that—observe me—he
will be found at such common, low places as a cockfight,
or a bruising match, with a kerchief high about
his neck, and a hat down on his eyes. And he will, like
as not, make expeditions to Bristol and Plymouth, where
he is less known, and where a man may attend a bit of
sport without his friends’ eyes upon him. Do I not know
your masculine ways, my Lord? And by and by he
will be found at the clubs, at the cards, and the betting;
and however lugubrious he may show his countenance,
and however sadly he may heave his sigh when he first
appears, ’twill wear off marvellous! And oh, and oh,”
cried Kitty, breaking into wrathful laughter, “then
there will be never such a buck on the town, nor one
with such an eye for petticoats, as your disconsolate
widower!”</p>

<p>“’Tis a biting tongue ye have in your head, me darling,”
said Kilcroney, half admiring, half displeased.</p>

<p>“Before the year is out,” concluded my Lady
triumphantly, “’twill be the duty of all his friends, aye,
and of poor dear Julia’s, who care for the welfare of her
children, to see that he is safe wed. I shall look to it
myself, I owe it to the memory of poor dear Julia!”</p>

<p>Kitty broke off. Her glance roamed. A frown
corrugated her white forehead. Kilcroney saw that she
was mentally seeking, among all her acquaintance, for
a substitute with the desired qualifications.</p>

<p>About the time of Sir Jasper’s bereavement, that
distinguished peer, my Lord Ongar, put off this mortal
coil. The title and fortune passed to a nephew, and it
was found that his widow, and the daughter who was yet
too young to have left the parent nest, were singularly
ill-provided for. My Lady Ongar, who was a Frenchwoman,
was in poor health; and much sympathy was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
felt for her situation, as well as for that of the little Lady
Selina, who, on the threshold of presentation to the
world, found herself suddenly at so great a disadvantage.
It was true that both her sisters had made good marriages;
one to Lord Verney, who had a house in town as well as
country property; the other to Squire Day, of Queen’s
Compton. But then, as Kitty Kilcroney said, who, that
had a heart in her breast, could suggest placing a high-spirited
girl under the charge of Susan Verney? “For
sure, my dear, somewhere back there must have been
a slave-driver among her ancestors. And as for Nan
Day, was she not lost in domestic bliss? and no one
ought to expect pretty Selina to bury herself in haycocks
and babies—other people’s babies!”</p>

<p>It was owing to the Viscountess Kilcroney’s influence
that the young lady was offered a post about the Princess
Augusta, the second of the bevy of beautiful Royal Princesses;
for, since assuming her duties as Lady-in-Waiting
to Queen Charlotte, Kitty had vastly pleased Her Majesty
in that capacity.</p>

<p>Not indeed that my Lady Kilcroney, who now had her
own personal experience to go by, approved of Court life
as a career for any young unmarried female. ’Twas
monstrous cramping, she declared to those who had her
complete confidence; and the Royals, perfect beings as
they were, and gratifying as it was to be chosen to serve
them, had a fashion of very naturally considering themselves
paramount, and their favour the chief benefit of
existence.</p>

<p>“I’ll not have the child’s youth sucked out of her,”
quoth my Lady, in the strict privacy of her chamber, to
the grunting Denis, who himself disliked the Court and
all its ways with a large intolerance, born of its demands
on his Kitty. “But a year, my love, ’twill give her a
certain stamp of elegance. We can scarce look for a
very great marriage for our Selina, with never two farthings
in her pocket, but there are a vast of pleasant
gentlemen of the second rank who water at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
mouth at the thought of anything favoured by
Royalty.”</p>

<p>It was not till Lady Selina had been some nine months
in her new post, and Sir Jasper Standish well-nigh a year
a widower, that the great idea flashed into Kitty’s mind.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper was a personable man, and had not yet
topped thirty-five; a very prime age for a bridegroom
with the greenness of youth cast off, the tedium of maturity
not yet as much as dawned. With your man of
thirty-five it is a point of honour to be as ready with the
generosity of youth as the lad of twenty, especially should
his fancy turn to sweet seventeen. He will have gained,
however, a vast experience, and, unless he be a fool, a
seasoned judgment. Sir Jasper was no fool; and though
he had so far justified my Lady Kilcroney’s prognostications
as to be more conspicuous at any dashing sport-meeting
than ever before, he kept chiefly in the company
of his own sex, and never so much as noticed the passage
of the most flouncing petticoat; and who was more likely
to know than Kitty, since she was the only lady in the
world whose society the widower now frequented?</p>

<p>At first the talk would be all of his Julia; but in a
little while lamentations gave way to more cheerful discourse
anent the young family.</p>

<p>It was in her capacity of godmother to little Kate
Standish that, a due interval having elapsed since the
loss of their ever-to-be-regretted Julia, Kitty Kilcroney
first addressed Sir Jasper on the subject of a second
marriage. She was, of course, quite prepared for the
shocked refusal which met her.</p>

<p>Was it possible my Lady Kilcroney should not be
aware of the solemn vow, by which he had pledged himself
to his Dying Treasure, to remain ever faithful to her
memory?</p>

<p>My Lady Kilcroney was very well aware of it. Heaven
knew, she exclaimed, rolling her pansy eyes towards the
ceiling of her drawing-room—she was for the while free
of her Court duties, and was established in the Hertford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Street mansion—Heaven knew, if ever there was anyone
in the world who could appreciate what a second marriage
meant to a true mourner it was she! When Bellairs
went—“Ah, you never knew my first, Sir Jasper! The
most excellent, the most estimable, the most generous
and noble-minded of men. There was not a condition
in his will, I do assure you! Everything, everything
left to me! ‘<i>My dearest wife, Kitty, in token of the
perfect happiness she gave me.</i>’ Those were his words,
Sir Jasper. But a year’s happiness, alas! and he, poor
seraph, scarce able to endure anyone in the room with
him with the gout so cruel settled in his joints that, if
you’ll believe me, his feet were like nothing so much as
warming-pans, and his hands—my poor Bellairs’ hands,
why, there were days when he could not have borne that
a butterfly should settle on them! When my cherished
martyr was released from his sufferings, did I not, like
you, vow in my heart that I never, never would replace
him?”</p>

<p>Here Kitty fixed her eyes upon Sir Jasper’s lugubrious
countenance, and, positively, though her tone was filled
with such pious melancholy, they twinkled.</p>

<p>“I fail to see the analogy, my Lady Kilcroney,” said
he huffily. “My Julia was as young as she was fair, as
elegant in form as she was virtuous in character.”</p>

<p>“True, true, Sir Jasper! Bellairs became, very shortly
after our espousals, a wreck, an absolute wreck. But he
retained the most admirable amiability of temper. ’Twas
indeed that which first drew my heart to him. ‘My
dear,’ he said to me, ‘when I heard that my poor old friend
Ned had gone smash, and shot himself, and left a little
daughter without a farthing to buy a ribbon with, I cast
about in my mind what I should do to help her. And,
faith, I can think of no better way, my dear, than to make
a rich widow of you.’ And then he set to laughing in
his droll, wheezing way. ‘I’m game for a year,’ says
he, ‘if you can stand the old man for a year,’ says he.
‘I’ll put you in the way of getting the best the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
can give you; honour and good repute, and wealth and
a young husband in due time—better than if your poor
father had kept out of indigo. If you’ll trust me, I’ll
trust you,’ says he. And my dear Bellairs kept his word
royally. He’d never so much as a suspicion of me; or
aught but a smile for my pleasures.” Here a tear suddenly
flashed. “I’m proud to say,” cried Kitty. “I
deserved his confidence. Is there ever anything so
beautiful in life as wedded trust?”</p>

<p>Sir Jasper went home thoughtful. His Julia had had
every merit, but if she had had also just the tiniest part
of Bellairs’ the Nabob’s generosity of mind, would he,
could he have so often—as alas! he had! But there
were times when he had been goaded, indubitably driven,
to seek distraction. Angel as she had been, to what
screaming vapours, what swoons had she not treated
him? How often also—here he held his head higher,
and made a knowing thrust at a door post with his gold-headed
walking-stick as he went by—had she not suspected
the vilest deeds when he had been as innocent as
the lambs in the field?</p>

<p>“You cannot,” said Sir Jasper, sapiently to himself,
as his marital crimes appeared before him suddenly
transmogrified into peccadilloes. “You cannot be said
to betray a trust that has never been reposed in you.”</p>

<p>Next time my Lady spoke of matrimony to the
bereaved, it was in the tone of one who regrets a rash
determination, but recognises its binding quality.</p>

<p>“What a pity, Sir Jasper, you should have been led
into such fond folly! To take such a vow! Irrevocable
of course. Who would have the dreadful courage to
suggest the breaking of a pledge to one who is now among
the saints. What if a father’s duty points one way? that
death-bed obligation sternly points the other.”</p>

<p>She pitied Sir Jasper—she did indeed. How was a
man, and he so young, to deal with five children, and they
with all the difficulties of life before them; character,
education and—heavens!—illnesses? Measles and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
mumps, hectics and whooping coughs, and all the rest of
it! “Poor Julia, could she but see now to what her intemperate
passion for you has led! If our Julia had a
fault—dare I say it, Sir Jasper?—she was a little, leetle
inclined to jealousy.”</p>

<p>When Kitty returned to Queen’s Lodge, to take up
service with Her Majesty, Sir Jasper and she had come
to discussing very freely the kind of person who might be
regarded as worthy to fill their dearest Julia’s shoes.</p>

<p>Kitty was full of suggestions, but, one way or another,
the paragons enumerated by the lady were never to the
gentleman’s taste.</p>

<p>When Lady Selina joined the Court circle, she was, if
truth be told, the very last young female whom Kitty
could in conscience have selected as a fitting companion
for a widower of Sir Jasper’s kidney, or the proper kind
of stepmother to his peevish brats. Nevertheless when
the idea came, it was with the brilliant conviction of a
flash of lightning.</p>

<p>Selina Vereker was not dark and masterful like Susan
Verney, nor was she soft and warm-hearted, all feminine
impulse and charm, like Nan Day. She was a bold piece,
Kitty had decided from the first, with a short nose and
a short temper, and hair under her powder as blazing as
Sir Jasper’s own, and a grey eye that possessed a certain
cold, reflective audacity which made Kitty thoughtful.
She was a judge of minxes. Withal the creature if not
pretty, was mighty attractive; with a little head on a
white throat, and a way of tossing it; slim, long limbs
like a boy, and a freedom of movement inside her voluminous
skirts that was almost unbecoming to her sex.
And the tiresome child was in a hundred scrapes, and in
Royalty’s black books before she had been a fortnight
at her duties. This was unpleasant for Kitty, who had
recommended her. And, as she had a kind heart, it
filled her with apprehension for the future. For if anything
so awful were to happen as that Selina should fall
into serious disgrace and be dismissed from Court, what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
in the world would become of her? So poor, so naughty,
and so innocent; with a pair of selfish sisters, and her
mother retired to a convent! Why, with Royal displeasure
upon her, never could she hope to ally herself
to a genteel family!</p>

<p>Sir Jasper! Was not the man to her hand? He
deserved a wife with some fire in her, after having so long
endured the deliquescent Julia, and he deserved too, sad
rake that he was, something with a temper of her own
to keep him to attention and in his place.</p>

<p>“To heel, sir, or beware, there are other fine fellows
in the world who are ready to appreciate what you have
the bad taste to neglect.”</p>

<p>Her mind made up, Kitty set to work with a transparent
artifice, to which only the blundering male would
fall a prey.</p>

<p>“Pray come to tea, to-morrow, sir—or stay, perhaps
better not, for I have Princess Augusta’s Maid-of-Honour,
the little Selina Vereker, and, oh no, I would not for the
world that you should meet!”</p>

<p>“And why, pray?”</p>

<p>“La, Sir Jasper, and you on the look-out for a new
Lady Standish! You might fall in love with her, to be
sure.”</p>

<p>“And what then, my Lady Kilcroney?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sir Jasper, Sir Jasper, that would never do!”</p>

<p>“And why not, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“But eighteen, sir.”</p>

<p>“I see no objection there.”</p>

<p>“Fie, Sir Jasper, and you turned thirty-six!”</p>

<p>“But thirty-five my last birthday, ma’am, as I’m a
sinner.”</p>

<p>“A sinner, indeed, Sir Jasper, and now you have it.
What? Would you, sir, mate with innocence, guilelessness;
lamb-like light-heartedness, and sprightliness;
you with——?”</p>

<p>“Come, come, my Lady Kilcroney. I’ve not been a
model husband, I dare say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“I dare say not, sir. Heavens, my poor Julia!”</p>

<p>“Your poor Julia, ma’am, would have driven a saint—Pshaw!
She was too good for me!”</p>

<p>“Believe me, sir, you should wed a young lady of some
experience, if not a widow; a staid female, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my Lady, I’m vastly obliged, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“And you so jealous, Sir Jasper, who could scarce even
trust virtue’s self, in the shape of Julia! La, to think
of you with Selina—such beauty, Sir Jasper; such
grace, such charm, so ready to take the pleasure of her
years, so pure ignorant of the world’s ways.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, my Lady Kilcroney, if I do not come
to your tea-party to-morrow, ’twill be that I am a dead
man.”</p>

<p>“Do not say you were not warned,” said my Lady,
and had the laugh of scorn to herself to see with what
conquering airs Sir Jasper glanced at himself in each
mirror when, departing, he crossed the long length of her
drawing-room at Queen’s Lodge.</p>

<p>The pretty Maid-of-Honour and the already foresworn
widower duly met over Kitty’s bohea, next afternoon.
Sir Jasper duly fell head over heels in love; and before
the week was out, they were engaged to be married.
Royalty approved, my Lady Ongar gave her consent
with tears of joy; and both Susan Verney and Ann Day
sent cool sisterly sanction.</p>

<p>Having secured her victim Kitty prepared herself to
enjoy every moment of the delightful process of decking
her for the sacrifice. What woman but does not feel that
in the trousseau lies the true inward satisfaction of the
bridal state? To a benevolent heart like my Lady
Kilcroney’s the choice of Lady Selina’s garments, the
proper expenditure of the funds entrusted to her for the
purpose by the widowed mother offered a task in which
duty went hand in hand with delight. Generous soul
that she was, she promptly decided to supplement the
Dowager’s exiguous allotment by a contribution of her
own: secretly, so as not to hurt the poor child’s feelings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
but to an extent which should in her estimation befit the
wedding of a maid-of-honour under the protection of the
Lady Kilcroney.</p>

<p>Needless to add that to bring Selina to Pamela Pounce
was almost the first of her desires as self-elected Fairy
Godmother. Who but Pamela indeed, could set out a
Bride so that her appearance on the great morning should
be an event in the world of Fashion? Pamela under
Kitty’s instructions—there never was such a combination
of intellect!</p>

<p>My Lady Kilcroney as she drove up through the bright
sunshine from Windsor was filled with anticipations so
agreeable and exciting that she had little thought to
spare for the silence and irresponsiveness of the girl
beside her.</p>

<p>Selina had a delicious little countenance, even though
she was sulking heavily; so when her glance strayed
reflectively upon her my Lady found nothing in the contemplation
to disturb her equanimity.</p>

<p>It was the first time in its annals that the House of
Mirabel beheld a carriage with the Royal liveries halt
before its portals, and the flutter in its discreet walls
was indescribable.</p>

<p>Madame Mirabel herself catching sight of the scarlet
splendour, through the first floor window, was seized with
the trembles, and had to send Miss Clara Smithson for a
glass of ratafia out of the back parlour cupboard before
she could control her limbs sufficiently to walk downstairs.
It was true that her immense agitation was
promptly allayed by Miss Polly Popple, who put her
head in at the door to say:</p>

<p>“It’s only my Lady Kilcroney after all, what’s brought
a pale Miss for a wedding hat. So don’t you put yourself
about, Madame Mirabel, and Miss Pounce that cool
it don’t look as if her opinions were what they ought to
be, and gracious goodness where is the roll of silver
ribbon came from Lyons? I laid it out of my hand,
Clara, when I ran up a while ago about Mrs. Lafone’s bill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
and him giving all sorts in the showroom. I wouldn’t
be married to an elderly gentleman what’s miserly not
for—where’s the silver ribbon for mercy’s sake? There’s
the bell going after me like mad. Thank you, dear.
Don’t put yourself about, Madame Mirabel—who ever
told you it was the Queen! It’s only my Lady Kilcroney—drat
it, there it goes again—I’m coming.”</p>

<p>Pamela Pounce had caught a glimpse of Kitty’s dainty
profile behind the misleading scarlet as the Queen’s
barouche halted; and it was with her usual graceful
self-composure that she swam forward to curtsy to her
patroness. Four steps and a nicely graduated obeisance,
with just an undulation which included my Lady’s companion,
Pamela had a perfect command of the correct
attitude. Then she waved her hand.</p>

<p>“Chairs, Miss Popple. Pray be seated, ladies.”</p>

<p>Then, with a pretty spring of alacrity in manner and
voice, a most respectful yet delightfully confidential
approach to familiarity:</p>

<p>“And what can I show your Ladyship to-day?” cried
she. “There’s the sweetest head, a twist of cherry tulle
with a bunch of green grapes, just come from Paris—made
for your Ladyship.”</p>

<p>Kitty waved the tempting suggestion on one side.
“Nothing for me to-day, my dear creature. I’ve brought
Lady Selina.”</p>

<p>Selina, who had entered, stood and sat down like an
automaton with every reason to be dissatisfied with its
surroundings, here gave her patroness a steely look of
enmity, and then cast down her eyes so that their long
eyelashes cast a shadow on her white cheek.</p>

<p>Pamela appraised the small set face and Kitty proceeded
to expound; “The fact is, Miss Pounce, I am
here with Lady Selina for a wedding order.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, my Lady.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” cried Kitty, warming to her subject,
“the wedding hat, no less, child, and the going away!
Oh! And a head for the dinner party I mean to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
in honour of the engagement. Princess Augusta has
promised to attend. And the wedding is to take place
from my house in Hertford Street, Pamela, the very
moment May is over. What with my Lady Verney
having a feeling about the mourning, and my Lady
Anne Day so set about with measles in her nursery,
there isn’t anyone as near to this dear girl as myself, if
it’s reckoned by old friendship.”</p>

<p>Here Kitty paused for breath and after duly waiting
for Lady Selina to express some acknowledgments of
these handsome sentiments, Pamela, in the young person’s
persistent mutism, was fain to remark that there was no
one like her Ladyship for kindness, that she knew. And
though this was but a deferential murmur, there was
conviction in it. Pamela had every reason for this
testimony.</p>

<p>Kitty glanced askance at the bride’s most unbride-like
countenance; she faintly shrugged her shoulders. None
of the Verekers had good tempers and she was not going
even to notice Selina’s moods.</p>

<p>“A wedding hat.”</p>

<p>Pamela pondered upon the bride, while her quick
brains worked.</p>

<p>(“Dear to be sure, the poor young lady! One would
think ’twas her funeral things they were getting together.
Who are they going to marry her to? And why is my
Lady Kilcroney managing it all, and that mortal tickled?)
I wouldn’t recommend white satin for my Lady Selina,”
she said out loud, “though I know it’s the usual thing,
my Lady. And if I might venture, it wouldn’t do to be
putting dead white next her face. No, my Lady Kilcroney,
no, my Lady Selina, not if you was to rouge ever
so and <i>that</i> would be a thousand pities; my Lady’s skin
is a treat to look at. And it’s her <i>cachet</i> to be pale with
those dark eyes—excuse me, my Lady, for dropping into
French, it’s a way I got into in Paris. Now I’d like
lace.” The milliner spoke slowly as if she were tasting
one by one, the condiments of an exquisite dish. “A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
fine brim of real lace, my lady, with a tulle lining, three
layers of tulle, and the middle one pale pink. Oh, pale,
pale, pale.” Pamela twiddled her fingers in the air,
mitigating the colour till it faded into nothingness. “The
tint they’re calling in Paris, <i>cuisse de nymphe émue</i>.
Excuse me, my Lady, I won’t be so bold as to translate
it. Yes, your Ladyship, the French have droll minds!
But your Ladyship has seized the idea; not pink, but
just a warmth, a lightening of the white, ’twill be exquisite.
A twist of silver ribbon to hold it together—Miss
Popple, where’s that silver ribbon that came from
Lyons? I have a model here,” went on Pamela, stooping
to pull out one of the deep drawers of the cupboard which
ran the length of the room, and in which the most special
treasures in the millinery line were hidden away from
the ordinary public, only to be brought out for the
favoured. “I have a model here which is the very
latest, out of Paris. It’ll never be seen at all, so to
speak, till next month, and that on a Queen’s head.”</p>

<p>Queen Charlotte’s Lady-in-waiting sprang up and
tripped across the carpet to stand by the milliner’s side.</p>

<p>“It must be worth while for a female of Fashion,” my
Lady was thinking, “to have a post about Queen Marie
Antoinette, always the first in the land in modes and in
looks as in everything else.”</p>

<p>Now Lady Selina Vereker, hearing the two women
whisper as they stood together, lifted her eyes and
watched and hearkened very intently.</p>

<p>“The young lady’s just engaged I take it,” said
Pamela, shaking the tissue paper from a cobweb vision
of blue tulle and lace.</p>

<p>“’Twas only ratified by Lady Ongar last night, from
her retreat at Wimbledon. (They say it’s a convent of
nuns my dear, but ’tis not generally known.)”</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure, the poor lady!”</p>

<p>Here Kitty lowered her voice, but Selina’s irately
keen ears caught the murmur.</p>

<p>“Sadly ill-provided for. My Lord Ongar’s affairs in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
a desperate state. Hardly a brass farthing between the
three poor girls! A most prodigious relief to have the
third settled.”</p>

<p>Then Pamela’s clear compassionate undertone.</p>

<p>“I trust the young lady is happy in her choice, so
young as she looks.”</p>

<p>The milliner’s eye wandered to the Bride-elect and
met her darkling gaze.</p>

<p>“Why, that goes without saying,” exclaimed my
Lady tartly, “since I made the match, Miss Pounce.
Sir Jasper Standish is one of my Lord’s oldest friends.”</p>

<p>“Sir Jasper Standish! Good God!” Pamela
started and wheeled round. She echoed the words in
accents which left no doubt as to the consternation
evoked by the name.</p>

<p>Her face was reflected in the glass in front of her, and
Selina had a vision of its blasted expression of horror
and disapproval.</p>

<p>The next moment Miss Pounce had resumed her usual
bland self-control, and was bending over the French hat,
feigning to be absorbed in twitching its knotted ribbons
into place.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Miss Pounce,” exclaimed Kitty, in
high surprise and anger. “And what have you got
against Sir Jasper Standish, may I ask, that you should
couple his name with such impiety?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, my Lady, nothing!”</p>

<p>Pamela’s hands trembled as she twitched the faint
pink ribbons. “Nothing but a bit of a business trouble
between my father and Sir Jasper, our place being all
but next door to Standish Hall—I crave your Ladyship’s
pardon, I’m sure, for letting my feelings go away with
me,—but Sir Jasper was hard on father over a mortgage.”</p>

<p>“Oh! a mortgage! Pish, child!” Kitty was immensely
relieved, though she could not conceal that she
considered it a great liberty in a milliner thus to obtrude
her family affairs upon the notice of distinguished clients.
She had not so very high an opinion of Jasper herself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
and Pamela was a prodigious handsome girl! She had
been actually trembling over what might have come out!</p>

<p>My Lady’s manner for the rest of the <i>séance</i> comically
varied between a dignified displeasure and the overwhelming
fascination exercised by the milliner’s supreme
talent.</p>

<p>Lady Selina submitted to all the trying-on and listened
to the prolonged discussions with the same demeanour
of angry martyrdom which she had brought into the
shop.</p>

<p>“You’ve been insufferable, my dear!” cried Kitty,
patience giving way at length, as the sleek royal horses
started on their homeward way.</p>

<p>Selina turned her long, brilliant eyes upon her companion
without speaking. There was a pert question
and an underlying significance in them, which further
exasperated the chaperone.</p>

<p>“’Pon honour!” exploded Kitty, “I marvel what’s
to do with you. You, with everything the world can
give you, and three as sweet hats chosen as ever I’ve
seen in my whole life! Such a picture as you’ll look,
a Bride, with your mother’s lace and all! and by the airs
of you, you might have been trying on sackcloth to go
to the stake.”</p>

<p>“You must remember, my Lady Kilcroney, that I am
in mourning.”</p>

<p>“Psha!”</p>

<p>“And Sir Jasper a widower himself.”</p>

<p>“And what of that, child?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” said Selina. “Do you think it’s going
to rain?”</p>

<p>Kitty looked at her long and earnestly. Was there
ever such a little shut-up countenance, such obstinate
close lips and such naughty secret eyes?</p>

<p>“I wish to Heaven,” she said, at last, “that you’d
say what you’ve got in your heart, child.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was just thinking about Miss Pamela Pounce!”</p>

<p>“And what of her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>My Lady still uneasily remained cross.</p>

<p>“Oh, I only thought she looked honest!” said the
girl. And not one other word to the purpose could my
Lady Kilcroney extract from her.</p>

<p>They drove into Windsor in a strained silence and
separated to their divers duties in no very cordial
mood.</p>

<p>Kind-hearted people in positions of authority are apt
to fall into the danger of doing good to their neighbours
in spite of themselves. They see so clearly the value of
the benefits they mean to confer, that fate having given
them the power to enforce their acceptance, they do not
hesitate to wield it. With the best intentions in the
world they become tyrants. Kitty had a real desire to
be of use to the orphan, and she was quite sure that the
plans she had laid for her were entirely for her comfort
and well-being. In any case matters had gone too far
for Selina, even to dream of such a catastrophe as a withdrawal
of her word.</p>

<p>The Maid-of-Honour had accepted Sir Jasper of her
own free will. If she had secretly repented, if she chose
to sulk and make a martyr of herself, Kitty knew better
than to encourage her by seeming to notice it. And my
Lady told herself that the moods of such a chit were of
no account. She was too fresh out of the schoolroom
to stand so much promotion all together—Maid-of-Honour,
Bride-elect, the pet of royalty, all in a couple of
months—a little spoilt cat, and if she scratched Jasper
’twould but do him a vast of good.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my lady Kilcroney felt slightly uncomfortable
until she next beheld the engaged couple together.
Then, indeed—it was the next evening after
their shopping drive to London, in my Lady’s own rooms—Selina
appeared to have completely forgotten her
gloomy fit. The child was in outrageous spirits, with
quite scarlet cheeks, taunting and mocking her ardent
lover, till he was beside himself.</p>

<p>Kitty forbore rebuke. In her relief she was full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
indulgence towards behaviour which, at another time,
she would have severely reprobated.</p>

<p>“My dear love,” she wrote to her husband that night.
She was still in attendance at Windsor and Denis, very
much injured, was alone at Hertford Street. “Everything
is going as well as possible. Do not forget to call
on Mr. Gunter’s about the wedding cake and on Mr.
Bartolozzi about the tickets of invitation.”</p>

<p>Could she have known how Lady Selina had employed
the afternoon of that very day, the poor Lady-in-Waiting
would have issued very different instructions.</p>

<p>For Selina had obtained leave from her “Royal” to
go to town about her trousseau. The Princess Augusta,
all blandness and good nature, offered every facility, even
to her own carriage.</p>

<p>How grateful was Lady Selina! But “Oh, no, Ma’am,”
she pleaded, “it makes me feel so horrid shy! There
we were yesterday, my Lady Kilcroney and I, in one of
the Queen’s barouches and every one turning round and
staring at us, and oh! so disappointed, Ma’am, not to
see the Royal faces. My mother is sending her own
maid for me, and we’ll take a chaise and Sister Verney
will meet me in the town.”</p>

<p>Princess Augusta looked very kindly at the child.
She liked her modest disclaimer and the little flattery it
wrapped about, and it all sounded very proper and becoming.
How could she guess that Selina was lying
like a little devil, that the audacious creature would
positively set out from the consecrated precincts of
Queen’s Lodge alone, take the common coach to town
and proceed on foot to Bond Street; in a kind of disguise
indeed, a plain bonnet, borrowed off a Royal housemaid,
which had a brown gauze veil to drop over her face, so
that she might have passed her own mother in the street
and not been known!</p>

<p>The cunning girl watched her opportunity and slipped
into Miss Pounce’s showroom at a slack moment. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
she flung back her veil Pamela’s colour changed; she
saw who it was.</p>

<p>Selina walked quite close up to her and the two stood
a moment staring at each other. The milliner was too
acute not to feel the moment big with importance, and
too shrewd not to guess at the cause.</p>

<p>“What did you mean,” said Selina then, “by saying
yesterday like that: ‘Sir Jasper! good God!’?”</p>

<p>Pamela was not often taken-to, but she felt herself in
a most disagreeable fix.</p>

<p>“La!” she faltered. “I could have bitten my tongue
out. I can only ask your pardon.”</p>

<p>“I want you to answer my question. What did you
mean?”</p>

<p>Pamela, who had been growing pale, grew paler.</p>

<p>“Father had trouble with him over a mortgage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tush with your mortgage! That’s only a bit of
trumpery. It wasn’t the mortgage. You know something
of Sir Jasper.”</p>

<p>The milliner hesitated: then she tossed her head.</p>

<p>“And if I do, my Lady? There! There ain’t anything
for you to suspect me about, I do assure you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t suspect you!” cried Selina wildly. “I
see you hate him! I hate him myself! I haven’t anyone
to help me. What do you know of him?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that would count as against a gentleman’s
honour,” said Pamela bitterly, recalling, with an inward
shudder, the vile trick that had been played upon her,
and the narrowness of her escape.</p>

<p>Selina caught the working-woman’s two capable
hands.</p>

<p>“I won’t get you into a scandal! I know you’ve
got your bread to earn. I’ll never mention your name
or let anyone guess! I promise! I promise! Look
here, I’ll put it differently: if you were me, would you
marry Sir Jasper Standish?”</p>

<p>Pamela drew a long breath and the truth leaped.</p>

<p>“I’d see myself dead rather!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>The absurdity of the phrase did not detract from its
effectiveness.</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Selina. “Thank you! That’s all I
wanted to know.”</p>

<p>She wrung the hands she had caught, whisked her veil
over her flushed countenance and turned to leave. On
the threshold of the shop she paused and flung back a
quick reassurance.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid. I’ll never betray you!” which
Miss Polly Popple, overhearing, promptly carried to the
awestruck ears of Miss Clara Smithson.</p>

<p>“There’s a low-class girl just been in the showroom
blackmailing Miss Pounce and gone off Heaving knows
with how much hushmoney! ‘I won’t betray you,’
says she. And Miss Pounce looking after her, that
distraught; you’d think she’d seen a ghost.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear,” said Miss Smithson. “Retribution
is gathering over that abandoned creature’s head.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In which is Manifest the Hand of the Sainted Julia.</span></p>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, my Lady Kilcroney, I haven’t a moment! The
most dreadful thing has happened!”</p>

<p>Selina Vereker stood before the astonished Kitty. She
was robed for Court ceremonial and looked a very splendid
young woman in brocaded whites and silver laces. Her
hair was full dressed and spread mightily in wings and
curls. In her hand she held a posy of pink roses. But
against all this elegance, the small countenance looked
troubled; it was, indeed, contorted like that of a child
about to cry.</p>

<p>“I haven’t a moment,” she repeated. “The Princess
Augusta expects me to attend her to the Duchess of
Hampshire’s ball, and even now she will be waiting for
me. But oh, my Lady, oh, my Lady, I thought I must
run in to tell you—Sir Jasper has broken with me!”</p>

<p>“Never say so, child! And the marriage for next
Monday as ever was!”</p>

<p>My Lady Kilcroney was in the long, narrow parlour
which formed part of her set of rooms in St. James’s
Palace. She, too, was in full fig; a marvel of glistening
white, with the fashionable purple trimmings that proclaimed
attachment to Royalty. The Bellairs diamonds
shone on her throat and bodice, and diamonds shot from
every angle of her piled and flying curls. At the Maid-of-Honour’s
words she shook and sparkled and quivered
in all her finery, looking like some magic tropical bird
spreading out wings for battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“The Princess Augusta is waiting for me!” cried
Selina, and sobbed.</p>

<p>“Let her wait,” quoth Kitty fiercely. She had
enough familiarity with the Royals now to appreciate
the fact that, after all, they were but human beings.</p>

<p>“What has happened? Sit there and tell me this
moment. Sir Jasper break off his engagement! Some
fantastick of jealousy, sure. The man’s mad! Why,
’tis but this morning you showed me that wonderful knot
of brilliants he gave you, child, on your complaining you
had no fancy for a dead woman’s jewels.”</p>

<p>Selina let herself fall into the chair indicated, and hid
her face in her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, the disgrace!” she moaned.</p>

<p>“It shall not be,” stormed her patroness. “You’ve
dropped your roses, child.”</p>

<p>“What, the roses? How—did I still hold them?
Oh, my Lady, the roses, ’tis they undid me!”</p>

<p>“Your roses undid you? Talk plain, in the name of
common sense.”</p>

<p>“The roses undid me, Madam,” said Lady Selina,
lifting up her head to grind her teeth at Kitty, as that
lady said afterwards, for all the world like her little Denis
at ten months old with the double ones coming. “How
should I know that when the beautiful pink roses arrived
they were not from Sir Jasper? and oh, my Lady, he
came storming into my parlour, demanding to see me,
and I scarce out of the hands of Monsieur Achille and
going in to him in my wrapper, I do assure you, not
knowing what prodigious important thing he had to say
to me, and he, my Lady Kilcroney, scarce able to speak
with the fierce rage. ‘The roses,’ he says, ‘where are the
roses you was to wear to-night?’ And there they were,
unpacked at his elbow before I had had time as much as
to take them in my hand. As I’m a living woman, as I
hope to be saved, my Lady, I, all innocence! ‘The
roses?’ says I, and he falls upon them, and, oh, to think
of it, in the very middle rose, hidden like a snake in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
grass, was a billet. A billet, my Lady Kilcroney, I
scarce know how to tell you—from——”</p>

<p>“Another gentleman?” screamed Kitty, jumping to
the horrid truth.</p>

<p>“Some stranger.”</p>

<p>“And indeed I hope so, Miss. And what was wrote
in it, pray?”</p>

<p>Selina dropped long white eyelids over those brilliant
curious eyes of hers which never seemed to corroborate
her lips, and, drawing an immense quivering sigh, the
corners of the same pretty lips going down over a sob:
“Oh, my Lady, the monstrous audacity of it,” she cried.
“The creature wrote—God knows who he can be—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<i>If you wear these roses to-night, Beauteous Selina,
your adorer will know that; whatever happens, he may
still hope.</i>’”</p>
</div>

<p>“’Pon my word,” said Kitty.</p>

<p>“It seems Sir Jasper had had an anonymous letter——”</p>

<p>“Ha,” interrupted the Queen’s Lady-in-Waiting.
“Now lift up your head, my love. ’Tis all a vile
plot. An anonymous letter, say you? Why, now all
is plain. ’Tis some base, envious creature—Heaven
knows who!” said Kitty. “Some old flame, some
wretch who wants to break the marriage for abominable
designs of her own. Psha! Was there ever a grosser
scheme? ’Twould not take in a mouse!”</p>

<p>“Sir Jasper will not listen to a word of reason,” complained
the bride-elect, now unveiling the fury of her eyes.
“He declares that there was guilt on my face; that he
had long had suspicions of me. He vows I have been
cold to him, dearest Lady Kilcroney, and that matters
must have gone very far between me and my lover—oh, is
it not monstrous of him?—before anyone would have
dared address me in such familiar words.”</p>

<p>“You need not repeat his raving to me,” cried my
Lady Kilcroney decidedly. “Dry your eyes now, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
hasten to your duty. Sir Jasper in his present mood may
very well not come to the ball, but he shall render an
account of his folly in this very room to-morrow morning,
and if the marriage does not take place from my house
next Monday as arranged, I am a Dutchwoman, as complete
a Dutchwoman as Mrs. Schwellenberg. I can say
no more. And I trust,” said Kitty, soliloquising as the
door slammed on the Maid-of-Honour’s exit, “and I trust
you will pay Sir Jasper back for this evening’s work in
good ringing coin, child, once you’re Lady Selina Standish.
As I have no doubt you will, my love—cold-hearted,
capricious?—aye, he’s not so far out there—and fiery
tempered to boot! It will give me a vast of pleasure to
see such a buck as he proper punished and tamed!”</p>

<p>She herself began the process with considerable conscientiousness
next morning in that interview which Sir
Jasper was ready enough to grant. My Lady was tired;
for to be in attendance on Royalty was to make of a ball
more of a fatigue than a diversion. She was anxious, too;
for the Queen had heard that it was Lady Selina’s visit
to Lady Kilcroney which had resulted in the Princess
Augusta actually being kept waiting; and had shown
displeasure at so extraordinary a breach of etiquette.</p>

<p>Kitty had no explanation to offer. She would have
died rather than hint at the threatening scandal. So
considerable peevishness had accumulated to fall upon
the devoted head of Sir Jasper.</p>

<p>But at first that individual was beyond feeling anything
save his own anguish. He roared like a wounded bull;
hit his brow till the powder flew; thumped his chest till
his vocal chords reverberated; paced the room, declaiming
in one breath that he was infamously betrayed,
and in the next that ’twas a just retribution for perjury
to the best of wives. He swore that his heart was broken;
never had he loved, never could he love woman as he
loved the false, intriguing Selina. Then he declared that
the organ in question had never been mended, but lay
in fragments under the tombstone sacred to Julia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>It was only when his passion had expended itself in
exhaustion that my Lady was able to make herself heard.
Then she dissected the value of the evidence upon which
he proposed to take so outrageous a step. She exposed
the folly of his jealousy, she mocked the absurdity of
the figure he cut.</p>

<p>“You have now,” she said, “lost the finest young
lady in the kingdom. You were about to contract a
marriage altogether beyond what a man of your position
and birth could hope for. You a middle-aged widower,
of no particular title—what’s a baronet?—of no such
remarkable fortune, with certainly no good looks to
commend you—you were about to espouse the loveliest
little creature in all the world, the Queen’s favourite,
scarce eighteen—a beauty, sir, of the first family! And
on some kind of monstrous whimsy, arising from your
own bad past—oh, of that I am quite certain, Sir Jasper—you
have cast away this flower, and you have cast away
with it your good name, your good fame, your own claim
to be a gentleman! Never will that cake be eaten for
your wedding with Lady Selina Vereker, I can promise
you that! Oh, she’s out of conceit with you, poor child!
‘Only one thing I beg of you!’ she says to me. ‘Do
not ask me to look at him again, for I never, never can!’
‘Then you shall not,’ says I. I uphold her, sir, in her
determination. ‘You’ve come out of this business with
flying colours, my love,’ I says, ‘and the Queen shall
hear the whole story.’ Fie, Sir Jasper, how you bellow!
I have one last word to speak to you, sir, aye, indeed,
the very last you shall ever hear from these lips, and that is
that I scarce think there’s a gentleman of your friends,
when it gets about the clubs, who would deem it worth
his honour to cross swords with such as you.”</p>

<p>She made a great flounce of silk skirts as if to withdraw,
but he was down on his knees clutching at them;
to do him justice, less affected by her threats and the
picture she had drawn of his awful position than by the
realisation that he had lost his bride. Never had Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
Selina appeared to his eyes in a light so entrancing;
never did he so clearly perceive the worthlessness of his
existence without her, as in this moment, when he believed
he had lost her. His distress was so genuine, his
supplications were so heartrending, that Kitty Kilcroney
could not but let herself be mollified. She exacted every
possible pledge of future good conduct, she obtained the
completest retractation, the most abject and repeated
apologies before sending for Selina.</p>

<p>When this young lady appeared Sir Jasper was put to
another half-hour of torture ere he was re-admitted to
favour; and even then the bride remained cold and
unresponsive, and looked with a hard glitter in her eyes
from one to the other, as if she had by no means forgiven
her betrothed, and was scarce grateful to my Lady
Kilcroney for her share in the reconciliation.</p>

<p>She had that moment, she informed him, sent the
parcel containing Sir Jasper’s presents, including the
betrothal ring, by a trusted hand to his house; she vowed
she considered matters vastly well as they stood; both
would yet repent a return to the old terms.</p>

<p>Sir Jasper did not kneel to Selina. He behaved, Kitty
thought, with a better dignity than she could have
expected and also more intelligence. He promised
perfect confidence in the future and a rope of pearls;
the most tender forbearance in all difficulties and emerald
earrings; the unswerving devotion of a manly heart and
six Catalonian horses to the finest coach woman ever
drove in. He furthermore volunteered to double his
wife’s pin-money, and altogether, as Lady Kilcroney
informed her Denis afterwards, made a more graceful
leg out of the business than could have been
imagined from the gross fashion in which he had cantered
in.</p>

<p>Lady Selina at length allowed an inert hand to lie in his
clasp, and even permitted him to touch an averted cheek
in token of her pardon; and it was an extremely chastened
buck that wended his way out of St. James’s Palace in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the direction of Bond Street, and it was a tremendous
sigh of relief that my Lady Kilcroney heaved.</p>

<p>“Now child,” quoth she, “as Mr. Shakespeare hath it,
‘All’s well that ends well.’ But do not make the mistake
of keeping up your frigid airs too long. The real way to
treat the wretches is to grant a little from time to time, and
demand a great deal.”</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged to you, I’m sure, ma’am, for your
kind interest,” said Lady Selina, and dropped her white
eyelids over her audacious cold eyes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>There has been another elopement</i>,” wrote Miss
Burney, the Queen’s reader, to her sister, “<i>and you
would never believe, my dearest Susan, who and in what
circumstances. Lady Selina Vereker was, you know, to
wed Sir Joseph Standish, that handsome widower (scarce
indeed a year widowed of his poor Julia; men are strange
things! I met her once, she was a very elegant woman).
Lady Selina was, as I say, dear Susan, to wed Sir Jasper
this actual next Monday, and my Lady Kilcroney who,
as you know, hath the kind of good nature that is for ever
interfering in other people’s affairs, was to give the
breakfast at her own mansion in Hertford Street. ’Twas
said she made the match. ’Tis quite certain she recommended
the young lady at Court. She must be vastly
sorry on both these accounts now. Princess Augusta
was to go to the wedding (the bride being her own Maid-of-Honour);
and altogether it is an odd, unpleasant business,
as you will hear. Last night, then, Lady Selina attended
the Royals to the Opera House. ’Twas to be her last duty
of the kind, and she was ablaze, my dear, they tell me, with
Sir Jasper’s jewels. The poor man was infatuated.
I cannot but pity him. She stood behind the Princess
Augusta in the box as usual, and no one knows the exact
moment of her disappearance. ’Tis positive she was
present at the beginning of the third act. Then all
attention was turned to the stage, and at the end of it she
was nowhere to be found! Conceive it, my dearest Susan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
to choose such a manner and such company, for such a
proceeding! To me it is beyond imagination; but, from
the letter she left behind her, there can be, alas! no mistake.
The young gentleman for whom she has shown her preference
in so singular a fashion, is, it seems, a person of no
note at all; a mere officer of the Marines, by name Simpson,
with scarce any fortune beside his pay. The whole
affair leaves one in a state of amaze, and I verily believe
the world is going mad.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>On the morning following the fatal evening just described,
my Lady Kilcroney was awakened from very
agreeable slumbers by the urgency of Miss Lydia Pounce,
who, placing a letter on the bed, begged in a tone so
important that her ladyship should wake up and read it
at once, that Kitty, omitting to scold, forthwith proceeded
to obey.</p>

<p>“Lady Selina’s woman also brought a large case, my
Lady. I’ve left it in the ante-chamber.”</p>

<p>Kitty was in Hertford Street, making ready in sweet
security for the wedding festivities; yet not so secure
but that her heart misgave her from the first moment
of the matutinal summons; it hardly needed the mention
of Lady Selina’s name to confirm her instant suspicions.
Yet she was ill-prepared, as she herself averred to all and
sundry later, for such a revelation of mixed baseness,
ingratitude and idiocy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>You have taken so kind an interest in my affairs,
my dear Lady Kilcroney</i>,” wrote the Maid-of-Honour,
“<i>that I wish you to be the first to hear that by the time this
reaches you I shall have become the wife of Lieutenant
Simpson of the Royal Marines. ’Tis no sort of match
for me, I am well aware, but I prefer him so infinitely to
Sir Jasper Standish that, seeing no other way out of it,
I have yielded to his solicitations. You may perhaps
remember that when we were with Their Majesties at
Brighton last month, there was a young man who used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
stand on the Parade and stare as we went by. That was
Mr. Simpson. From the moment I had accepted Sir
Jasper—and indeed, it was scarce fair to put such pressure
on me, and me so young—I knew I had made a great
mistake. And oh, Heaven knows, how I tried to induce
him to break it off! When I had succeeded at last—for
’twas I who wrote the anonymous letter about the roses,
and ’twas I placed the billet-doux inside the rose (I still
think ’twas a very ingenious trick), if it had not been for
you all would have gone well. No one would have blamed
me, as you told Sir Jasper yourself, but you would interfere,
my Lady, and you brought it on again. And now,
if you please, will you explain matters to Sir Jasper?
I am sending the jewels to you that you may give them
back. And oh, I am so glad to be free of him, and of
them, and of Court I can’t tell you! Oh, pray do not try
your hand at match-making again, my Lady, for indeed
you have no talent for it.</i></p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“<i>Your obedient servant,</i></span><br>

“<i>Selina Soon-to-be-Simpson</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>I am sorry to treat my fat, good-natured Royal so.
She was a kind piece. But ’tis a vile life.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>“And oh, oh, ’tis she is a vile piece! Simpson! Let
her be Simpson to the end and die an old woman!”</p>

<p>Kitty was more outraged, more incensed, more profoundly
disturbed than she had ever known herself.
Why, indeed, had she meddled with match-making, and
who would be looked on coldly over such scandal at
Court, but she? all innocence, kind heart and good
nature! She had half a mind to send in her resignation
and have done with it.</p>

<p>As for Sir Jasper, he was well served, for an odious,
bullying, stupid fellow, who couldn’t make himself agreeable
when he had the chance of his life! <i>She</i> put herself
out any more for him? <i>She</i> expose herself to the unpleasantness
of breaking the news to him? Not Kitty,
not my Lady Kilcroney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>The little woman made up her mind in a minute. She
would go out of town. It was fine April weather. Bath
would be at its best. She preferred it out of the season.</p>

<p>She would pass on the jilt’s letter to Sir Jasper. Lydia
should call a hackney coach and go round with it and
the jewels at once.</p>

<p>“And I shall add a line,” thought Kitty, “that will
prevent him from coming to seek sympathy from me!”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>When you have perused the letter of Lady Selina,
by this time Simpson, dear Sir Jasper</i>,” she wrote,
“<i>perhaps you will feel as I do, that what has
plucked you apart has not been either your indelicate
behaviour or the young lady’s capriciousness, but the
hand of your sainted Julia</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was fortunate that there was no one in the room to
hear the awful words that escaped Sir Jasper’s lips when
he came to this. What fell from them was the blasphemy:
“Damn Julia!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In which a Wonderful Bit of Luck Comes out of<br>
Miss Pounce’s Bandbox for Somebody Else</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Pamela Pounce</span>, having inadvertently marred a
most desirable alliance and incidentally assisted a mad
elopement, told herself that it was a sad, tiresome world
in which love brought trouble to high and low, and that
the best thing a woman of intelligence could do, was to
put such stuff out of her head and be grateful that she
could work.</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure,” Pamela wondered, “how did people
get along at all who hadn’t some honest occupation to
keep their silly minds off themselves?”</p>

<p>’Twas only to be expected that she should have such
fretful faces to suit with heads and hats; disappointed
mothers coming to complain that Miss’s toque was the
wrong shade of blue, passionate damsels vowing that
the very sight of a pink rosette made them sick.</p>

<p>Pamela could read “as if it was wrote in print,” as
she said herself, the fluctuations of many an <i>amourette</i>,
many a well-laid matrimonial scheme. Where her art
might help she was ready with the most obliging disinterestedness;
when failure had followed on her best
efforts she took the despite of her disappointed clients
with the utmost philosophy.</p>

<p>It was well that she was philosophic, for her own poor
misplaced romance was going singularly ill; so ill, indeed,
that it might be said to have dwindled down to nothing
at all.</p>

<p>After his tender and respectful farewell to her on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
night of Sir Jasper Standish’s Christmas ball, Pamela
had hardly seen anything more of her once too ardent
admirer. She told herself that ’twas all as it should be;
he now understood the kind of girl she was; and his
present attitude showed more true affection for her than
his former light-minded persecution.</p>

<p>If she had been born his equal, or if she had not been,
humble as she was, a creature of principle, what could
have parted them? for if ever there had been love——</p>

<p>Pamela was very valiant, and kept her courage up
with such reflections. And she found considerable distraction
in her work, and quite a fund of consolation in
the increased success which it was bringing to her. But
when events enabled her to coax a bit of happiness to
someone else, through the witchery of her talents, it was
more real satisfaction to her than the tot of the weekly
accounts.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Hats for these young ladies, Madam? Yes, Madam.”</p>

<p>“A hat for this young lady,” said Lady Amelia Vibart,
severely.</p>

<p>She looked disapprovingly at Miss Pamela Pounce.
She disapproved on principle of anyone whom she considered
her inferior, and when a person belonging to the
working classes was presuming enough, not only to have
good looks, but to make the most of them, Lady Amelia
considered it a direct attack on the prerogatives of those
destined by Providence to hold a higher station. Only
that she had been recommended to Madame Mirabel’s
shop as the one place positively, in the whole town, where
any self-respecting woman of fashion could get herself
a hat to be called a mode, she would have walked out of
the showroom at the mere sight of this creature, so tall
and self-possessed, so white and ruddy, clothed in garments
that fitted an indecently fine figure to positively
scandalous nicety, a creature who moved as if <i>she</i> were
the condescending party, and carried taper hands each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
side of her waist-ribbon, not exactly akimbo, but with
an air—yes, in very truth, an air of independence.</p>

<p>Miss Pounce looked at her visitors reflectively; a high-nosed,
haughty, short, stout lady, flanked on either side
by two tall daughters, the one beautiful, astoundingly so,
a perfect miracle of loveliness; and the other—plain. No
doubt about that; pleasant, bright-eyed, witty-looking,
but plain.</p>

<p>“A hat for Miss?” said the milliner, her glance resting
upon the less favoured but unmistakably the elder damsel.</p>

<p>The high-nosed lady tossed her head.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” she said with a glare. Here she
pushed the beauty forward, “For this young lady.”</p>

<p>She looked round for a chair, let herself subside on a
velvet stool, obsequiously advanced by Polly Popple,
and began to talk very volubly and pompously.</p>

<p>“I have been told that you have very good taste.
What can you suggest for my daughter? Perhaps I
had better tell you I am Lady Amelia Vibart. The
Duchess of Queensberry has recommended you. I am
sure that I shall find that you deserve her kind recommendation.
I trust that you will. It is not my custom
to come to shops myself, I generally expect to be served
in my own house, but the Duchess advised me—this is
Miss Jane Vibart. I think you must have heard of Miss
Jane Vibart.”</p>

<p>She paused, inflating her nostrils and fixing an ox-like
stare upon the young woman, who really seemed quite
independent.</p>

<p>Pamela turned her attentive gaze upon Miss Jane
Vibart. It was perfectly true that she had heard of her,
for there was a great deal of talk in the particular distinguished
circle that patronised Madame Mirabel on the
subject of the beautiful Miss Vibart. Something superlative,
overwhelming, an absolute miracle, she was
proclaimed to be; but the head milliner preferred something
with a little more life and mind in it, herself. She
betrayed by no sign that she recognised the overwhelming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
favour and opportunity that was here bestowed upon
her, but inclined her head sideways, after the most elegant
millinery convention, and said: “Indeed, Madam?
Certainly, my Lady,” as if these were any ordinary new
customers.</p>

<p>Lady Amelia snorted, took an immense breath, and
burst into fresh volubility with, if possible, an increased
pompousness.</p>

<p>“It is of high importance, you understand, that Miss
Jane Vibart should be suited in the finest taste, I must
request you to give your earnest attention to the matter.
Stand forward, Jane, have I not already told you to
stand forward? And you, sit down, Sarah. You’re
in everybody’s way. Now, young woman, what do you
suggest? I want something of distinction; girlish,
you understand, but absolutely elegant. Everyone will
be looking to see what Miss Jane Vibart is wearing. ’Tis
Miss Jane Vibart’s first appearance upon the Windsor
Walk. I think it will be very good business for you if
you suit her. It will bring you a great many orders. I
trust you will consider that, young woman, and represent
it to your employer.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, your Ladyship,” said Miss Pounce, when
Lady Amelia stopped for want of breath, “I am sure,
speaking for Madame Mirabel, that she will be duly conscious
of your Ladyship’s land patronage, which we
shall do our best to deserve—Miss Popple, bring me the
primrose set, if you please,” and as the assistant sped
away, Pamela looked out of the window and remarked
that it was a fine day. Now it was exactly according to
the best tradition of shop etiquette that the customer’s
attention should be respectfully distracted during an
enforced wait, by some polite conversation; and, indeed,
most of Miss Pounce’s ladies had a good deal to say and a
good deal to listen to, when fortune favoured them with
a quiet moment in Miss Pounce’s company, but Lady
Amelia gazed upon the milliner with an arrogance that
marked her repressive intention, and then turned her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
head away and told Sarah to give her seat to Jane or the
child would look a fright for the rout to-night.</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure,” thought Miss Pounce, “to see that
poor piece jump up, and her younger sister take her seat,
all as if it were the most natural thing in the world, if
<i>that</i> don’t tell a tale! I wish ’twas the plain one I had
the hatting of, I’d get some credit out of it. Why, if you
put a sun bonnet on the beauty there, she’d look out of it,
no more nor less than the same handsome doll—you’ve
dropped your <i>mouchoir</i>, Miss.”</p>

<p>Pamela handed the elder Miss Vibart back her useful
linen handkerchief with a movement as deferential as
if it had been the finest gossamer and valenciennes; and
that young person took it with a pleasant smile, blew her
nose in it lustily, and thrust it into her reticule, no whit
ashamed of its sensible quality.</p>

<p>“That’s the girl for my money,” thought the observant
shopwoman.</p>

<p>What a world in miniature was this showroom of hers!
Pamela had already seen many a comedy, many a drama
played out in it. Here was a case of Cinderella on the
wrong sister. A shame it was to treat a nice young
lady so, because she happened to have a little pug nose
and a wide mouth.</p>

<p>“La! Miss Popple, give me that. (One would think
you’d had to go to Paris for it.) And straight from Paris
it is, my Lady, and all the trouble in the world to get it
through, things being as they are over there—as straight,”
said Miss Pounce, turning up her fine eyes, “as any confection
in this establishment. The newest idea, Madam.
Hat, robe and trimmings, down to the parasol all
complete, all in harmony, as you perceive. The ve—ry
lat—est id—e—a,” said the milliner, dropping her
syllables one by one, spreading the flounces and frills
over a chair and poising the hat on her clenched hand.
“Ex—qui—site, that’s the word, isn’t it, Miss? O, it
will become either of your young ladies to perfection.
The embroidered lawn, very delicate, very girlish, Madam.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Absolutely correct for a young lady that’s a <i>débutante</i>.
Not white, Oh, no, your Ladyship, cream. Pull up the
blinds over there, Miss Popple.—Cream, a shade deeper
than ivory, and the pale green ribbons, the blonde, your
Ladyship sees, just flung over the hat and fastened with
this bunch of primroses. Did your Ladyship ever behold
anything more fanciful and pretty? I would not put a
bit of ribbon or set another pin into that hat,” said Miss
Pounce, “not if you was to offer me a thousand pounds
to do it! Oh, Paris ma’m. Yes, ma’am. Hot from Paris
if one can use such a word for a thing so cool and April-like.
Any young girl,” said Miss Pounce, not without
a spice of malice, “would be noted in such attire.”</p>

<p>“O Mamma,” said Jane. It was the first time she
had spoken. She was gazing at her reflection in the
mirror, crowned by the wonderful hat. Her voice was
awestruck, as if she were overwhelmed by the sight of
her own loveliness.</p>

<p>Lady Amelia pursed her lips, and then with some tartness
bade her daughter turn round. As she obeyed,
Miss Pounce seized the vapoury gown and cunningly
held it up against the young lady’s figure. A kind of
maternal greed obviously struggled with prudence in
Lady Amelia’s heart. She gaped meltingly, then frowned,
put her finger to her lip.</p>

<p>“Miss could try them all on,” insidiously suggested
Pamela Pounce.</p>

<p>“O Mamma,” said Miss Jane Vibart, and:</p>

<p>“O Mamma,” cried her sister. “Jenny looks a
perfect picture in that hat, and I’m sure the dress is the
most lovely thing I’ve ever laid eyes on. It would be a
sin and a shame not to get them for her.”</p>

<p>But Lady Amelia was not so swiftly moved to decision.
The garment was tried on and the beautiful Jane was
turned and twisted in every direction; while her mother
hummed and ha-ed and criticised.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure I like the green waist-ribbon, no,
nor the primroses, neither, mere hedgerow flowers. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
nice artificial garden rose, now, and a good blue taffety
sash.”</p>

<p>“O Mamma,” protested the plain Miss Vibart in tones
of anguish.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do it, your Ladyship,” said Pamela, with
a slightly heightened colour, deftly whisking the hat
from the fair head and motioning her underling to conduct
the patient back behind the screen.</p>

<p>“It’s the primrose and the green—your Ladyship will
excuse me—that makes the real Parisian elegance of this
gown. If your Ladyship requires ordinary English taste,
there’s Madame Flouncer’s in Clarges Street, a very
respectable firm, very respectable indeed, as I’ve heard
tell, where your Ladyship would find herself better
suited.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, young woman!” spluttered Lady
Amelia.</p>

<p>“Yes, you may toss your old head, and sniff and snort,
my Lady Amelia,” thought the shopwoman, remaining
herself quite imperturbable, save for that deepening
colour, “but you’ll not come it over me with your high
nose and your country taste, and you needn’t think it.”</p>

<p>They gazed upon each other steadily for nearly a
minute, then the dowager’s glare wavered.</p>

<p>“It’s an original effect of colour, I’ll say that,” she
said weakly, “and—does that parasol go with it?”</p>

<p>Miss Pounce took up the minute article in question,
shook out the fringe, opened it, and held it gracefully at
divers angles.</p>

<p>“An ivory handle, your Ladyship perceives, cream
<i>poult de soie</i> of the first quality, the sarcenet lining beautifully
gathered, isn’t it, Miss? a deeper shade of primrose,
so becoming to the complexion, and such a background
for the powder—really as never was.”</p>

<p>“An ivory handle,” said Lady Amelia, pulling a long
upper lip, “and fringe and what not! Absurd extravagance
for a girl.”</p>

<p>“It goes with the whole inspiration, my Lady. A cheap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
parasol or a wrong colour would—Foh! would destroy
it all.”</p>

<p>After which Lady Amelia fell to haggling. She demanded
a personal interview with Madame Mirabel. She
declared that the advantage to the firm of clothing the
beautiful Miss Jane Vibart, if not sufficient compensation
in itself, ought to make a considerable difference in the
charges made.</p>

<p>Miss Pounce regretted that Madame Mirabel was not
visible. Madame Mirabel could not be troubled on these
matters. She who spoke was solely responsible for the
department. She regretted that she could not regard
the favour of clothing Miss Jane Vibart otherwise than
as a business transaction. What was the price?
Nothing! Twenty-five guineas—given away! Oh, no,
my Lady, she did not think she could use up a square
of her ladyship’s old Honiton instead of the blonde. No,
nor make it twenty guineas and throw in the parasol.
It was a tremendous contest. Lady Amelia haggled
with a zest and energy that spoke of long practice and
an actual enjoyment of the process. Miss Pounce’s
cheeks were flaming when the transaction was at last
concluded, and she had after all gracefully conceded a
reduction of five pounds.</p>

<p>(“And let it be a lesson to you, my dear,” she said to
Miss Popple afterwards. “And when you see a customer
come in with that kind of an air about her, put it up to
her at once. What was the set marked at, Miss Popple,
dear? Eighteen? You don’t say? Well, let that be
a lesson to you.”)</p>

<p>“And do you want nothing for Miss?” enquired the
astute milliner, turning with a kind smile to the plain
girl. “I’ve a positive sweet of a Tuscan straw with
cornflowers, and a blue muslin. It would suit Miss to a
charm. Very reasonable.”</p>

<p>Lady Amelia, one stout foot poised for departure—she
had a high aristocratic action suited to her nose—paused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“Cheap? did you say?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“Miss Popple, the blue muslin and the assorted
<i>chapeau</i>.”</p>

<p>Lady Amelia gazed through her eyeglass and Pamela
rejoiced to see that she hesitated. Colour and sparkle
had risen to the plain Miss Vibart’s cheeks, and the
flash of joy brought out all kinds of beauties; dimples,
and tiny smile waves, and an archness in the curve of
that too wide mouth over milk white teeth.</p>

<p>“<i>Chapeau</i> and <i>robe</i>,” she said emphatically, “for you,
my Lady, since your Ladyship has already so generously
patronised us, and not to disappoint the young lady,
eight guineas. Pray Miss, let my Lady see you in the
hat.”</p>

<p>Her hands lifted to her country straw, Sarah Vibart
paused, looked at her mother, and the light died out of
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Jane, you will want another gown,” muttered Lady
Amelia. “And blue was always your colour.”</p>

<p>“O Mamma,” said Jane, with a smile of joy that made
her for the moment quite exasperatingly lovely.</p>

<p>It was that smile that settled her in Miss Pounce’s
opinion.</p>

<p>“Of all the mean, unnatural girls! ’Tis a shame, I
call it, a shame!” thought she.</p>

<p>If her business conscience would have allowed her,
she would have placed the Tuscan on the beauty’s head,
and contrived to give the curls a good tweak as she did
so. But as it was, she masked her feelings by handing
the garments to her underling, loftily commanding: “You
carry on with the order, Miss Popple. Regretting
Madam, I have an appointment,” and sweeping majestically
away.</p>

<p>As she did so, she in her turn dropped a pocket handkerchief,
quite a dainty little article with an embroidered
P. and a delicate edge of lace, smelling too of the lavender
with which the Kentish mother kept her elegant town
daughter liberally supplied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>The plain Miss Vibart made a plunge and picked it
up.</p>

<p>“Good God, Sarah!” cried Lady Amelia, the exclamation
jerked out of her by a proceeding so very
unbecoming.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss,” said Pamela, looking into the
candid green eyes, that refused to acknowledge the
rising tears. “I hope some day I’ll have the dressing
of you, and ’twill be a pleasure and privilege.”</p>

<p>“Jane,” cried her mother angrily, “don’t stand
staring, and if you poke like that I might as well throw
all the money into the sea. Try on the hat this minute, and
you may tell Madame Mirabel—you—you young woman—that
I consider it very impertinent of the person who
presides over the department to go away like this; a
vast bit of disrespect, and I’ve half a mind to cancel my
orders. Hold your tongue, Jane. I would, if it were
not that it might hurt the Duchess’s feelings.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In spite of Lady Amelia’s censure, it was scarce a
fortnight afterwards when a very small page boy brought
a very large folded sheet to Madame Mirabel’s shop,
marked immediate, which he was enjoined to deliver
straight into the hands of Miss Pounce. This document
ordered with equal imperativeness and urgency, that
Madame Mirabel’s principal woman should instantly
proceed to 6a, Queen Street, bringing a selection of heads
suitable for Miss Jane Vibart’s wear that night at the
masked ball at Hampshire House. “<i>It is very important
that the principal woman should come HERSELF.</i>” This
was heavily underlined. “<i>Lady Amelia Vibart must insist
on her personal attendance.</i>”</p>

<p>“Hoighty, Toighty,” said Miss Pounce, and stood
looking down at the page with one hand on her hip,
eyelids drooping, a quizzical smile, and a tilted chin.</p>

<p>“And how’d it be if I can’t give up my Duchesses
and Marchionesses to whom I’ve been engaged for goodness
gracious knows how long? There, trot along, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
tell my Lady I’ll do my best, seeing she’s so pressing!
Yes, yes. I’ll come. And shut your mouth, little boy,
in the name of Heaven, or you’ll be picked up for a frog
and brought to the Royal Aquarium.”</p>

<p>Number 6a, Queen Street was a small narrow house
wedged in between two larger residences; one of those
domiciles that seem made for the impecunious fashionable.
Miss Pounce serenely preceded Madame Mirabel’s
liveried porter who negotiated an alarming array of
bandboxes, not without some bumpings, up the narrow
stairs, in the wake of the country footman. On the
second floor landing she ordered the important chattels
to be deposited, and bidding the porter have a hackney
in half an hour, stood a monument of composure while
the country footman knocked at the panels of the door.</p>

<p>There was a clamour within, voices, among which
Lady Amelia’s didactic tones could easily be distinguished,
objurgations, lamentations, sobs. The footman invited
Miss Pounce by a leer to share the joke, knocked louder,
and at an exasperated “Come in,” flung open the door.
As Pamela entered the long, dingy bedroom a silence fell.</p>

<p>The beauty was sitting in an arm-chair by the empty
fire-place, her face buried in her hands, evidently in tears;
the elder sister was bending over her with a countenance
of concern, while in the background stood a frightened-looking
elderly maid, her finger to her lip.</p>

<p>“Come in, come in!” repeated Lady Amelia, bursting
into speech. “Shut the door. I’m sorry to have
troubled you, I’m sure. No. I don’t want the bandboxes.
Miss Jane Vibart cannot possibly go out to-night.
She has most successfully contrived to make
such a spectacle of herself that I doubt if she will be able
to show again for the rest of the season.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamma!” exclaimed the elder daughter in
reproachful accents. “’Tisn’t Jenny’s fault!”</p>

<p>“You’ll not say it’s mine, I trust?” retorted a deeply
annoyed parent, and, as the beauty lifted her face, Pamela
saw that it was indeed disfigured almost out of recognition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
by that distressing if not alarming complaint, the toothache.
The poor girl’s left cheek was swollen to comicality.</p>

<p>Jane Vibart, with a loud boo-hoo, buried her head in
her handkerchief again, and Sally, with a championship
which Pamela thought the younger ill deserved, protested:
“But Mamma, Mr. Tugwell hurt her so dreadfully
last time, that poor Jenny was terrified——”</p>

<p>“Foh! I’ve no patience with her,” stormed the lady.
“She’ll have to have it out now, and ’twill hurt her a
vast deal more. Provoking creature, and it is so important,
so particularly important that she should go
to-night. Well, Miss, if you lose your chance of the
match of the year, you’ve none but yourself to blame,
and let that be a comfort to you. Pray, young woman,
did you not hear me say I should not require your goods?
O! I could shed tears of vexation, and it all so neatly
planned! The Duchess herself would have seen that
you took the floor with Mr. W., and says she to me:
‘The child has but to unmask at supper, and I think we
may say ’tis as good as done.’ Mr. W., his uncle’s heir,
and such a personable, worthy young man, by all
accounts, and looking to be settled. Well, well! Meeking,
take Miss Jane to her apartment, and tell Mrs.
Martha to apply the leeches. ’Tis time for me to be
dressing.”</p>

<p>Whether rendered irritable by pain, or overwhelmed
by disappointment at the probable loss of Mr. W., or
goaded by the thought of the leeches, certain it is that
the afflicted daughter broke out with a passion which
amazed Miss Pounce so much that she turned on the
threshold to stare, and perhaps even admire.</p>

<p>The beauty declared that Mamma was a nasty unkind
thing, and that she herself wished she was dead.</p>

<p>“Jane!” cried Lady Amelia, in a voice of thunder.
“Sarah, take your sister away.”</p>

<p>Ere the sobbing girl, advancing in three totters and
a stop to gasp, could reach the door, Lady Amelia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
bethought herself of a fitting punishment which spoke
volumes for the matron’s methods of education.</p>

<p>“Your sister shall go in your place to-night. Yes,
Jane, not another word. I have quite made up my mind.
Sarah, get ready to accompany me.”</p>

<p>Pamela slipped out of the room after the girls, and
was witness on the landing of a small fraternal scene
which confirmed her previous opinion of the lovely
Jane. This aggrieved maiden first nearly fell over the
bandboxes, and then was seized by such a convulsion
of rage and jealousy at sight of them, that, shaking
herself free of Sarah’s encircling arm, she slapped
and pinched her sister, and then, at Pamela’s horrified
interference, dashed up the staircase to her own
chamber.</p>

<p>“’Pon my word,” thought the milliner, “Mr. W. may
have had the escape of his life! A doll lined with a vixen!
’Tis the most dismal combination. Don’t cry, Miss,”
she went on aloud, as Sarah sniffed into her useful pocket
handkerchief, “don’t cry, there’s a dear young lady!
Let me come in your room with you, and see what I’ve
got in these boxes. You shall look nice to-night, or my
name’s not Pamela Pounce.”</p>

<p>Now Sarah’s chamber happened to be a narrow slit
at the back of her mother’s apartment, for of course
Beauty had to be well lodged, no matter how pokily plain
Miss Sarah might fare.</p>

<p>Nipping a bunch of bandboxes dexterously in each
hand, Pamela bundled after the astonished Cinderella
into her dingy little cell.</p>

<p>“As for the price, Miss, bless you,” she whispered
breathlessly, with her back against the door. “You’ll
pay me when you’re married.” Then she smacked her
lips as if the dish of her choice were spread before her. “I
don’t know when I’ve took to anyone as I’ve took to
you. La! We must have candles though, your window
giving on a shaft as I see, and being, so to speak, worse
than none. But I’d rather dress a lady by candlelight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
any day in the year. And what was you thinking of
wearing, Miss?”</p>

<p>“O dear, I’m sure I don’t know!” cried Sarah. “My
muslins are dreadful washed out, and Mamma said I
must do with her mauve Tabby made over, for she
couldn’t afford to dress two——”</p>

<p>Here there came a knock at the door, and Meeking,
the drab elderly maid, entered, carrying a white
silk brocade gown, powdered over with little rosebuds.</p>

<p>“My Lady says you’re to wear this, Miss Sally, and I’m
mortal glad,” added the woman, dropping her voice and
looking, as if for support, at the milliner, “that you
should come to your rights once in a while! Too bad
the way this pore young lady’s put upon, Miss. There!
I’ve said it now, and I’m glad of it. Her Ladyship’s
just given me notice. I wish I could dress you, Miss
Sally, I do indeed, but I’ve got to go back to your Mamma
this instant minute.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you put yourself out, Ma’am,” cried Miss
Pounce, sweetly. “I’ll help your young lady with all
the pleasure in life! I was just about to show her the
heads I brought on approval.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the Abigail darkly, as she withdrew,
“there’s heads enough in this house to-night, and that’s
the truth!”</p>

<p>“I hardly like, though,” exclaimed Sarah, “to wear
poor Jenny’s clothes.”</p>

<p>“Why, you’re a sweet creature!” The milliner shook
out the glistening folds. “’Twill suit you, Miss——”</p>

<p>“Oh, my ugly face!”</p>

<p>“Ugly! As far as that comes to, Miss Vibart, there’s
ugly beauties, and there’s charming—well, charming
uglinesses, since that’s your own word. I’d never call a
lady ugly who’d so fine a figure, and so bright an eye—and
if your mouth is a bit wide, Miss, sure your teeth are
a picture; and if your nose is a trifle snub, there’s something
so merry and arch in the way it cocks when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
smile, that I for one would not have you different. I
vow I would not!”</p>

<p>Pamela was in the act of passing the Beauty’s fine
gown over Cinderella’s shoulders, and as she twitched it
into place she proceeded with fresh energy.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, Miss, is that you’ve
been so set aside that you’re afraid to smile and be merry.
Let yourself go to-night, and you’ll see——”</p>

<p>“Why, ’twill be right enough,” said Sarah ruefully,
“so long as I’m masked—all the dancing ladies are to
be masked, you know. I’m not afraid but I can hold
my own then. ’Tis the thought that all the while people
are looking at me they’re saying ‘poor girl,’ and comparing
me with sister. However I may get on with my
partner at the rout to-night, the moment I take off my
mask——”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t go for to say that, Miss! You haven’t
seen the head I’ve got in this bandbox. One would
think,” cried the milliner enthusiastically, “that your good
angel had inspired me, for I’ve got here the very mode
to match Miss Jane’s brocade and to suit you. Well,
there! there won’t be no gentleman at the ball to-night,
wishing you was your sister. I’ll take my oath o’
that.”</p>

<p>And indeed, when some twenty minutes later the
plain Miss Vibart contemplated her image in the glass,
she conceded that she might very well hold her own. By
a couple of twists of clever fingers, Pamela Pounce had
contrived to loosen and display her curls to an advantage
hitherto undreamt of. When a hairdresser was called
in, his services were not wasted on Sarah. And the
“head”; what an exquisite indescribable trifle, and
how becoming! The twist of silver tissue as light as the
most delicate cloud, the single hint of blue, and the one
full pink rose! It lent an ethereal aspect to the flying
curls of powdered hair; Sarah’s small round face took a
something elfin, and, as she smiled at herself, roguish,
that made the milliner clap her hands and vow that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
was delicious, and that her own anticipations were far
exceeded.</p>

<p>Sarah turned and hugged her unexpected friend before
obeying her mother’s call.</p>

<p>“I’ll come round to Madame Mirabel’s in the morning
and tell you all about it. See if I don’t.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Sarah Vibart looked so modest and inconspicuous
as she slipped into Madame Mirabel’s hat shop on the
thundery June morning after the Masked Rout at Hampshire
House, that Miss Popple deemed it not worth her
while to enquire what her pleasure might be.</p>

<p>“Foh!” thought Polly. “Some poor country cousin
on the spy for fashion,” for no one can be so haughty as
the young person who caters for the high and mighty.</p>

<p>What was her surprise to see the head milliner conclude
the affairs of a most important dowager in perfunctory
haste, with a peremptory, “Door, Miss Quigly,”
and advance with the most urgent courtesy to the customer
in the plain print gown, with the unmistakable
home-trimmed hat, and the not at all pretty face underneath
it!</p>

<p>“Step with me into the dressing-room, Miss Vibart.
I’ve got your <i>matinée</i> ready to fit on,” said Pamela, with
a knowing wink.</p>

<p>And when the two found themselves together in the
little screened off apartment with the big mirror, Miss
Pounce scanned her companion’s face with the most
searching anxiety. There was something in that face that
had not been there before, an emotion between trembling
joy and crucial doubt; a colour that fluctuated, a vague
and veiled glance. And a smile that wavered.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss?” panted Pamela, as the girl, letting
herself fall into a chair, seemed to float away on a dream:
“well, Miss, how did you enjoy of yourself? Wasn’t
my head the prettiest there by a long way? I don’t
think the Duchess herself had such a bit of real art, and
I ought to know! I’m sure, if you only looked as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
did upstairs in that little room when you took off your
mask——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear kind thing, I never took off my mask
at all.”</p>

<p>“What, Miss?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t!”</p>

<p>“Of all the pities! There, I might as well have spared
my trouble, I see. There ain’t a mite of use in trying to
help those that won’t help themselves, that’s flat!”</p>

<p>“Nay, pray, pray don’t be vexed with me! You’ve
been such a friend to me! You’re the only friend I have!
Oh, I must tell you! There’s no one in the world I can
tell.”</p>

<p>There was such real distress in the girl’s whole air, and
at the same time, some pathetic hope that seemed to
cast a pale beam across her trouble like sunshine on a
gloomy day, that Pamela swallowed down her natural
irritation and began to feel moreover that her efforts
might prove to have been not so altogether wasted after
all. More than this, how could she fail to be touched
by the appeal: “You are my only friend”? Flattered,
too, considering—and Pamela was far too sensible not to
consider—the difference in their station.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried the plain Miss Vibart, as if the gentle look
the milliner cast on her had been a Moses wand and the
spring gushed forth under its touch. “Oh pity! Oh,
why am I not beautiful, like Jane? I never envied her
before—never, never—but oh, why did I go to the party
at all? If I hadn’t known him first, if he had not been
so wonderful kind and clever and charming and loving
to talk to me, and understanding me so—oh, oh, and so
handsome! Oh, I’d never have known what he was if
Jane had had him first!”</p>

<p>“There, don’t cry, you poor thing! Why, now, you
said you’d tell me about it, Miss, and I’m sure, I think it
uncommon pleasant of you, Miss, and I’d never take
advantage—no! ’Twill be as sacred—as sacred—no
not if I was to be drawn and quartered! But there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
Miss, why, how do you know ’tisn’t all going to end
lovely? How do you know the gentleman isn’t like me
and wouldn’t rather have you than the beauty, fifty
thousand times?”</p>

<p>Here came such a lifting of swimming eyes, such a
timid smile that Pamela thought she, for one, never
wanted to see anything sweeter than the face of the plain
Miss Vibart.</p>

<p>And after that the confidences came, broken, halting,
but explicit enough for such quick wits as those of
Madame Mirabel’s head woman. How Sarah had
followed her mother, with a higher heart than she had
ever carried in her bosom to any entertainment, into the
great, splendid ball-room of Hampshire House, safe under
her mask: and they had scarce been there a five minutes
when up comes the Duchess of Queensbury in a great fuss,
followed by a tall young gentleman, and she says to
Mamma, for the Duchess is Mamma’s cousin by marriage,
and has remembered the relationship since Jane came out,
for Jane, she says, is the most beautiful creature in the
world and “so she is,” cried the loyal sister, breaking off
her narrative with a trembling lip.</p>

<p>“’Tis the young gentleman’s looks I want to hear
about,” Miss Pounce interpolated skilfully. “Mr. W——
I suppose? Him your lady Mamma was alluding to.”</p>

<p>“Mr. W. it was, Mr. Walsingham. And oh, he’s a
person of great consequence, for he’s the nephew and heir
of the old Marquis of Harborough, him that succeeded
his brother, you know, and none of them ever married.
And oh, dear, my dear friend—your name’s Pounce,
isn’t it? I’d rather call you by your Christian name
if you don’t mind. Pamela? Oh, I like that. Dear
Pamela, I thought when the Duchess introduced him
and he bowed and smiled I’d never seen anything so
agreeable, nor so well looking. With such straight and
honest eyes and so kind a smile. And the Duchess was
in such a fuss, as I told you, she wouldn’t listen to Mamma
who wanted to explain about Jane, and I think she’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
little deaf, too. ‘Here, Edward,’ she cries, ‘here’s Miss
Vibart, what I’ve told you of and you’d better engage
her at once, for once it gets about what face is behind
that mask, there’ll be twenty clamouring for her. Oh,
you’re a lucky dog,’ says she—that’s the way she speaks,
and I think it’s rather gross, but Mamma won’t have it,
because she’s a duchess—‘Oh, you’re a lucky dog,’ she
cries, ‘and there won’t be a buck in the room that won’t
want your blood when midnight comes and that face is
revealed.’”</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure,” said Pamela, with a sucking
breath. “And do you think Mr. W.—I can’t help it,
Miss, I shall always call him that: ’tis so mysterious like—didn’t
hear what your Mamma tried to tell the Duchess?
Did he take you for your sister straight off?”</p>

<p>An overwhelming blush spread over the plain Miss
Vibart’s face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Pamela Pounce,” she cried, “’twas very silly
and cowardly of me, but I didn’t want him to find out.
I thought for once I’d know, even on false pretences,
what it means to be admired and courted. And oh, my
dear creature, yes, I’ll be truthful. I liked him so much
from the very first that I couldn’t, I couldn’t make up my
mind to his going away and leaving me.”</p>

<p>In the pause which ensued, the milliner discreetly
waited while last night’s heroine once again fell into a
retrospective muse. Suddenly the girl broke out:</p>

<p>“’Twas the strangest thing! Our tastes met at every
point. ‘Never think, sir,’ cries I to him, ‘to find me
entertaining company, for I’m the veriest country mouse——’
‘Country!’ cries he. ‘Madam, there’s no life
for anyone but in the country to my mind. This town
existence, what is it? How can anyone but an idiot
substitute the fresh air and the green fields and the fine
views and the wholesome activities, the pleasant neighbourly
intercourse, for this inane round of dissipations
in the atmosphere of smoke, the hideous confinement of
brick and mortar and the feverish intercourse with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
strangers between people who can have naught in common,
and as like as not can never meet again?’”</p>

<p>“La,” cried Pamela, “how you remember it all, Miss!
And sure, to my mind, ’twas scarce an auspicious opening.”</p>

<p>“Nay, but it was, for it set me off laughing. And,
cries I, an idiot and inane! ‘You’re vastly obliging, sir,
but pray remember that I, at least, am subject to authority.’
‘And so am I, madam,’ cried he, ‘’tis by my
uncle’s orders that I am in the town, so you and I may
perhaps call ourselves the only sane people in a room full
of vapidity. And such being the case,’ he went on,
‘you will allow me to add most respectfully that we
scarce meet altogether as strangers, and that I trust our
first meeting may not be the last.’”</p>

<p>The milliner gave a whistle.</p>

<p>“Quick work,” quoth she, “a’most like putting on the
feathers before the straw is stitched together.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nay indeed!” cried the other again, “we were
somehow so comfortably at home with each other from
the first! And after we had danced a minuet—it is not
vanity on my part to say that I can dance and that better
than dear Jane, though, to be sure, it scarce matters how
she steps for none will look but at her face—we got on
amazing in the figures, and afterwards better still in the
talk we had together. Never was there such harmony
of taste, I do assure you; I told him how vastly I preferred
the country gentlemen to the town fop, and he told
me the town young lady could never hold a candle to the
fresh country creature that would be up betimes in the
dairy, and still-room. And oh, a dairy is all my joy,
and as to a still-room why, I scarce know how the time
flies, once I’m in ours! Our housekeeper is very old, and
Mamma is very kind and lets me help her. And there’s
no butter half so good as mine in the county, and the dear
cows, I love the very sight of them. Aye and I can milk,
too. And there’s not a herb in the garden I don’t know
the use of. And——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“Why, Miss,” said the milliner, amused, “what a
mistress you’ll be of a country house of your own, one of
these days!”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s what he said!”</p>

<p>“Did he indeed?” Pamela laughed out loud.</p>

<p>“Nay, but,” the girl’s face, which had wonderfully
brightened, fell; “You must remember he thought I was
the Beauty all the time! He has heard about Jane.
’Tis quite clear. He is in love with her without ever
having seen her, and that was why the more charming,
the more ardent, respectfully ardent, he was, the more
my heart sank. Though indeed I do think our minds
were in sympathy, and to be sure, sister scarce knows
rhubarb from angelica, or cream cheese from curds.”</p>

<p>“Ah, if I’d been you,” said Pamela Pounce with fire,
“I’d have pulled my mask off, Miss, and faced him and
said, ‘By your tongue you’re a man of sense, show yourself
one by your eyes.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, you may talk,” Sarah cast a desperate upward
glance at the kindling face: “you that’s so handsome!
Little you know what it is to feel plain. ’Tis as I have
told you, I couldn’t, aye—that’s the word!—face it.
And so I slipped from him, even as all the assembly was
summoned to the supper-room, and hid myself. And oh,”
cried Sarah, between laughing and crying, “when Mamma
found me at last, sitting with the maids among the cloaks,
she was very angry first. ‘And where have you been?’
cries she. ‘The Duchess and Mr. W. have been looking
for you everywhere. Mr. Walsingham’s mad after you,
child,’ and oh,” here Sarah sobbed, “she was most angry
because she thought he had liked me too much. And
when I told her he took me for sister, ‘why,’ said she,
‘put on your mask this minute, Miss. And I forbid you
ever to let on that you took Jane’s place. He has told
the Duchess that you’re the most intelligent young
woman, that your mind and your principles are all he
could desire—believing you to be Jane of course. Things
could not be better! His intentions are most serious!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
And now,” cried Sarah, drying her eyes desperately,
“Sister’s had her tooth out this morning, and the apothecary
says in a week there’ll be nothing to show for it.
And though there’s been a message from the Duchess to
say Mr. W. wished to call to-day, Mamma has wrote back
that Jane has taken a cold at the masked ball and must
keep her room for a few days. But oh, Pamela, when he
comes and looks upon her—why, you can guess how it
will be!”</p>

<p>“’Tis a monstrous shame,” the partisan exclaimed.
“I wouldn’t put up with it, Miss. And all the time ’tis
yourself he’ll think he’s getting. You ought to up and
tell him straight and let him make his choice.”</p>

<p>But Sarah, pulling on her shabby gloves and drawing
her hat over her red eyes, shook her head. “I couldn’t
do that,” said she. “Mamma says if I breathe a word
’twill be the basest treachery to sister. And she’ll keep
me out of the way,” she added under her breath.</p>

<p>The girl then flung her arms round the milliner’s neck.
Sarah was indeed lacking in propriety.</p>

<p>“I’ll send back your head. ’Tis as fresh as ever. And
thank you a million times. At least I’ve had a peep into
happiness.”</p>

<p>It was quite ten days later when Pamela Pounce
received an urgent message from Miss Vibart to come
and see her after closing hours.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Mamma and Jane are going out and I shall be
quite alone. Do come, I have something so strange to
tell you.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Miss Pounce did not need to be bidden twice to such an
appointment. Her warm heart had been considerably
preoccupied on the subject of the plain Miss Vibart’s
affairs.</p>

<p>She was shown in, not to the fireless dark slit of a room
overlooking the shaft, but to quite a comfortable small
bedroom on the street. Sarah, in an elegant white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
muslin wrapper, sprang up from her writing-table to
embrace her friend.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, look at me!” she cried. “I ain’t ashamed
of my face to-day. Indeed I quite love it. Oh, I’ve
just been writing to all the dear old people at home, my
blessed old nurse and Mrs. Comfit—that’s our good housekeeper—to
tell them—to tell them my great news! Oh,
Pamela, I wanted to tell it by degrees and surprise you,
but I can’t. ’Twill out! It is me he wants.”</p>

<p>“Mr. W.?”</p>

<p>“My own dear, darling Edward Walsingham, who
else? Oh, was there ever such a lucky girl? Oh,
Pamela! Here, sit beside me. Let me hold your hand.
Let me hold your hand, your warm, dear hand that lifted
me up, when I was oh, in such a pit of despond.”</p>

<p>The two sat together on the maiden’s bed, and Pamela
began to cry, as women will, over the tender emotions
of the moment.</p>

<p>“I’m as glad, my dear,” she said, “as glad as if you’d
given me a hundred thousand pounds. Gladder! And,
how did it come to pass?” she drew her sucking breath
of delighted anticipation.</p>

<p>“This morning, then—oh, when I think it was only this
morning!—sister being quite unswollen and looking
lovelier than ever, Mamma put her into the blue muslin—your
blue muslin, you remember it?—and made Meeking
do her hair in a new way with a black ribbon bow at the
back and little curls, like the Duchess of Devonshire, and
oh, sister did look lovely! And just as she was ready, up
comes Joe Footman to say the Duchess of Queensberry
and Mr. Walsingham was in the withdrawing-room.
And Mamma takes sister by the hand and ‘Come, child,’
says she. ‘And if you poke when you come into the room
I’ll slap you,’ (Sister does poke sometimes you know.)
And off they go, without so much as a look at me. I’d
been helping to dress sister, you see, holding the hairpins
and that. And there was I in my old frumpy gown, and I
just looked at myself in the glass and I thought: ‘You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
plain thing, how dare you be jealous of beauty, and your
own sister, too! And if you cry, you silly creature,
you’ll only make yourself plainer, so what’s the good of
that!’ And I wouldn’t cry, dear. I picked up sister’s
clothes and was putting them away, trying not to think.
Oh, trying so hard not to think—of him downstairs,
looking worship at Jane, when all at once up comes Joe
Footman again. ‘And you’re to come down, Miss,
you’re to come down this minute to the withdrawing-room.
Her Ladyship has sent for you,’ And oh, you’ll never
believe the dreadful thought that came into my head and
how near I was saying I would not obey Mamma, for to tell
you the truth, I thought she wanted to show off Jane with
my plainness. But then I thought, ‘Nay, daughters
must do as they’re bid,’ and I set my teeth and down I
went, just as I was. Oh, Pamela, such an untidy, ill-dressed
poor girl, with a sad pale face! And oh—I can
hardly believe it myself—the moment I came into the
room up he jumped—yes, he, Mr. W.—and I heard him cry
out quite joyful: ‘Ah, I knew I could not be mistaken.
Ah, ’tis she, ’tis she indeed!’ And then he took both my
hands in his and kissed them one after the other very
respectful. And says he, ‘Forgive me, Madam, forgive
me! Your mother will explain. It has been an absurd
misunderstanding. I found a treasure, and I thought I had
lost it. Oh, forgive me if I seem too precipitate!’ And
Jane got up and went to the window and began to tap on
the pane, and Mamma and the Duchess looked at each
other. And the Duchess said: ‘I congratulate you,
Amelia, this is the most crazy bit of good fortune that ever
befell a mother,’ And everything did seem rather crazy,
for there was Mamma at one minute looking as if she could
kill me and at the next clasping me and calling me her
favourite child. And oh,” went on the plain Miss Vibart,
“it is precipitate, but what does that matter, when we’re
both so happy? And oh, it seems I must tell you, and
’tis not vanity! that the moment he saw Jane he stared
and looked so mortal disappointed and seemed so confused,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
falling back two steps indeed, instead of coming forward,
that the Duchess cried: ‘What’s the matter with the
fellow? Ain’t she pretty enough?’ And he said:
‘This is never the young lady to whom you introduced
me at Hampshire House, ma’am. There is some cruel
mistake here,’ he says. And oh, he said to me, when we
were alone together a little while ago that when he saw
that empty face—that’s what he said—that doll’s face,
that bit of waxwork, his blood ran cold, and then says he:
‘When you came in!’—oh dear, I’m not dreaming!—‘When
I saw your charming expressive countenance,
full of life and spirit and wit and goodness’—he did say
that—‘I could not hold myself back, I had to speak at
once, lest I lose you again.’ And now,” concluded the
future Marchioness, turning her radiant visage upon the
milliner, “he’s gone to Harborough House to tell his
uncle, and Mamma and Jane have gone out to a dinner
party, and if you’ll help me into my frock, dear—yes, it is
one of poor Jane’s—I’ll be ready for him when he calls
back, to wish me good night.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In which Miss Pamela Pounce has done with<br>
Love</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pamela Pounce</span> was nothing if not a business woman,
as her history will have shown. She had not only those
valuable intuitions which divine the public taste, she had
the still more priceless quality of inspiring it.</p>

<p>Before she had completed her first year with Madame
Mirabel, the millinery department had become the mainstay
of the house; and Pamela felt herself in a position
to hint to her employer how very much more it would be
to their mutual advantage that she should be given a
proprietary share in the business, than that she should
set up for herself.</p>

<p>Set up for herself! The mere thought of such a catastrophe
put Madame Mirabel in such a flutter that she had
to be revived with ratafia on the spot. There was no
concession that she would not have been willing to make
to prevent it.</p>

<p>Pamela had prepared a scheme, which was just, fair-minded
and practical, like herself. She was willing to
invest a thousand pounds for the development of the
department, and continue to direct the thriving showroom,
if Madame Mirabel would admit her as partner with
a right to half profits.</p>

<p>A sketch of an agreement was drafted between them,
drawn up by Pamela herself. Fortified by this document
she sought her redoubtable aunt.</p>

<p>“Now, Aunt Lydia,” said she, “here’s the opportunity
of your life. You lend me a thousand pounds, and I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
give you ten per cent. for three years and pay you
back at the end of it with a bit over. And if I
drop down dead between, you can come on Madame
Mirabel.”</p>

<p>Lydia was no fool. She was as fond of money as only
such a nature can be, and had indeed gathered together
quite a substantial hoard in her long years of lucrative
employment. She made all the difficulties, of course,
which the circumstances demanded, but Pamela, who
saw the gleam of greed in her eye, knew that her cause
was won from the outset.</p>

<p>She good-humouredly consented to sign the stringent
document which Lydia thought necessary for her safety;
and to obtain Madame Mirabel’s signature to it also.
The transaction was concluded without much more delay,
and Miss Pamela Pounce passed from the position of
underling to that of partner.</p>

<p>The matter was, needless to say, kept private between
Madame Mirabel and herself. It is never wholesome for
the reputation of a business concern to have these conveniences
of management discussed; and, for the mere
sake of discipline where large numbers are employed
and easy jealousies excited, no change affecting authority
can be acknowledged.</p>

<p>Miss Smithson and Miss Popple, therefore, while unable
to blind themselves to the fact that their aged employer’s
infatuation for that scheming Miss Pounce was more
lamentably evident than ever, still buoyed themselves
up with the hope that her true character would be revealed
before the eyes of the too-trusting dame.</p>

<p>Miss Sarah Vibart’s wedding order; bride and bridesmaids
hats—Jane was chief bridesmaid, an advertisement
which, as Pamela herself said, would have been worth
paying for ten times over—brought a rush of new <i>clientèle</i>
to the Bond Street house. Mr. Walsingham’s wedding
was the event of June—luckily timed before the unexpected
death of the Marquis of Harborough—and it is
scarcely too much to say that the first thought of every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
lady of fashion who received a ticket of invitation was:
“Pounce shall make me a new hat!”</p>

<p>Lydia, who kept a close tongue where her nest-egg was
concerned, began to unbend considerably towards her
niece. Nothing succeeds like success. You could scarce
have dragged five shillings out of her, had the girl been
lingering on at Tabbishaw’s, but, as matters stood, my
Lady’s Abigail felt “warm in her inwards,” every time
she thought of that thousand pounds which was so likely
to bring a blessing upon her high sense of family feeling.</p>

<p>She took to inviting Pamela to a dish of chocolate in
the sewing parlour at Hertford Street of a Saturday
afternoon, promising her also a plate of those queen cakes
“which my Lady’s still-room maid do turn out rather
well, and which you’re so fond of, my dear.”</p>

<p>These invitations Pamela accepted with increasing
frequency; and if Lydia happened to be washing her
Ladyship’s best lace caps or ironing out her ribbons, it
was only becoming, from a niece to an aunt, that she
should lend a hand, particularly considering the money
obligations between them.</p>

<p>But Pamela’s real reason for presenting herself at
Hertford Street lay so deep down that it could scarcely
be said that she acknowledged it even to herself.</p>

<p>She was hankering for news of Jocelyn Bellairs; and at
last, by an artful twist of the conversation, Miss Lydia
was induced to drop a stray word in connection with
him: “that rubbish! Her Ladyship had got a place
for him at Bristol, with an India merchant,” and she
hoped to goodness he’d keep steady, and they’d hear no
more of him.</p>

<p>That was the first item of information which Pamela
gathered for her starving heart. She tried to tell herself
what a relief it was not to have him hanging about, and
how splendid that he should have work, and how sure
she was that he, so clever, would now make a way
for himself, even as she had done. But it was poor
comfort!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>After two Saturdays wasted, she once more heard the
beloved name mentioned: this time again in no uncertain
tones of condemnation.</p>

<p>My Lady was so put about. Lydia hadn’t known her
so upset since the day my Lord was took up as a highwayman;
and she the widow Bellairs and he Denis
O’Hara.</p>

<p>“That audacious young villain! He’s been making
a regular popinjay of himself at Bath. There’s my Lady
Nan Day, recovering from the measles, writes: ‘Your
nephew, my dear, your nephew is the rage here; driving
the most elegant curricle you ever saw with a pair of
bloods, which, my Philip says, make his mouth water.
Has he come into a fortune or not?’ writes my Lady
Nan—and she was always a spiteful one—‘for he will
need it,’ says she. ‘We was all mortal sorry that his
horse, what he set such store by, failed at the Spring
races.’ My Lady has wrote to him,” pursued Lydia, her
green eyes maliciously fixed upon her niece, “to explain,
for goodness gracious sake, ‘for unless he’s robbed the
mail, Lydia,’ says she, ‘or been more successful on the
highway than my poor Denis’—and that was what put
it into my head, Pamela, my love—‘I’m very much
afraid,’ she says, ‘’tis his master’s strong box he’s been at,
and that will spell prison,’ she says, ‘and the name so
well known.’ Oh, the shame of it!”</p>

<p>“Shame indeed!” cried Pamela, her glance flashing
back at Lydia’s taunt; she knew very well what gave
such extra zest to these tales; but she, Pamela, was not
one to wear her heart on her sleeve for an old
magpie to peck at.</p>

<p>On the following Saturday she saw from the first
moment she crossed the threshold that Lydia was big
with news, unpleasant enough to make her bursting to
tell it.</p>

<p>Pamela was past mistress of exasperating tactics
herself, and there was some very pretty fencing between
the two, by which Lydia was forced to restrain her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
old-maidish desire to plant a dagger in the bosom of the
younger maid. Pamela had so much to discourse about
on the new Turban mode, and the last letter from Madame
Eglantine to Madame Mirabel.</p>

<p>“Poor thing, she’s in all the states, what with these
new dreadful doings and the insolence of the people, and
Ildefonse letting his hair grow and going out to clubs
o’ night to talk blasphemy. Ugh!” said Pamela, “I
never could abide that man.” And my Lady Amelia
Vibart, haggling over the wedding bills, ’twas a scandal!
And had Aunt Lydia heard the last horrid tit-bit about
my Lord Harborough and Miss Falcon? And wouldn’t
it be a pity if Mr. Walsingham were to miss coming in
for the title after all? ’Twas said my Lord Harborough
was mad set on marrying her, when there wouldn’t be
a mite of reason why she shouldn’t have a brat to put
Mr. W.’s nose out of joint!</p>

<p>Lydia was still seeking for an interval in which to
thrust, when My Lady’s bell rang with the double pull
which indicated that Miss Pounce had better hurry herself,
or my Lady would know the reason why.</p>

<p>Pamela smiled to herself as the door was banged behind
her Aunt; then she sighed.</p>

<p>Aunt Lydia was a tabby if ever there was one, but
oh, dear, what dreadful bit of tattle was she bound to
hear before the evening was out? And oh, dear, what
a pity it was that things went so contrary in this world,
and that poor girls had hearts at all!</p>

<p>She had hardly had time pensively to nibble through a
queen cake—for Pamela was much too sensible to let any
sentimentality interfere with her appetite—when Lydia
reappeared, and, with much flouncing and head tossing,
informed her that, it being a dratted nuisance that people
wouldn’t mind their own business, it had come to her
Ladyship’s ears, through Pompey, that Pamela was
present in the house. Nothing would serve her Ladyship
but that she must come up at once about a “head”
for to-night’s concert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>Pamela shook the crumbs from her apron and rose with
the imperturbable alacrity which it was her pride to
bring to all affairs of business.</p>

<p>The day was hot, and my Lady’s big bed-chamber a
delicious cave of coolness after the highly-elevated
atmosphere of Lydia’s own parlour. The amber curtains
were drawn before the big windows; there was a shining
sea of parquet floor on which delicate French furniture
made here and there an attractive island. An immense
bunch of roses on the spindle-legged dressing-table just
caught the breeze from the wide-open window, and wafted
fragrance. My Lady herself, extended in a vapour of
white muslin on an amber satin couch, lazily fanning herself,
was as agreeable a spectacle as any heated young
woman with refined tastes could hope to gaze upon.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Miss Pounce,” said Kitty affably.
“(Lydia, get out the bandbox with the saffron head.)
Now, my dear, good, kind creature, look at it. Yes!
I know. ’Tis the sweetest thing I’ve laid eyes on this
season, but conceive my horror, Miss Pounce, when I
heard anon that Her Majesty was to be present at the
Duchess of Portland’s to-night. Conceive my horror!
I saw myself with the Queen’s eyes! I tell you, Miss
Pounce, my days at Court would have been counted.”</p>

<p>Here Lydia was heard to murmur, with the familiarity
of long service, and a backward scratch at her niece that
she was tired telling her Ladyship that the last year’s
head from Madame Eglantine, which her Ladyship had
never worn but the once, would be the very thing for her
to wear to-night, “and a genteel, tasty, Frenchy confection
it was,” which her Ladyship wouldn’t better
not if she ransacked Bond Street.</p>

<p>“I tell you, you perverse piece,” cried her mistress,
fanning herself with an energy calculated to make
even the spectator feel hot, “that turn myself into a
frump with a last year’s mode, I’ll not do, even to
please the Queen. Pamela, child, I’ve set my heart on
the saffron head. I vow and protest those gold ospreys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
with the cluster of saffron roses and the little wreath of
green leaves between, I vow and protest ’tis the very
dream to go with my India gold-embroidered gown.
’Tis there on the bed, my dear, as fine as a cobweb!
There’ll not be another like it in the room. And there’s
never anything so elegant as white and gold of a hot night.
With my dark eyes, Pamela, and the gold ospreys—oh,
but the gold ospreys, so airy, so fly-away! And Her
Majesty who will not even tolerate feathers! I’d have
worn my high band of diamonds—pshaw! it grieves me
to the very soul! What can you suggest?”</p>

<p>Pamela put her finger to her lip and corrugated her
white brow in the profoundest thought. Kitty held her
breath as she watched her. The fate of nations might
have been hanging between them. Then said the
milliner decisively, “I see nothing for it. We can’t do
it, my Lady. The ospreys will have to go.” Then, as
Kitty’s face fell, she added briskly, “But there! I often
say to myself, what seems a trial is a blessing. Why
should not your Ladyship set a fashion? It came to me
just as I looked at your Ladyship’s gown and the fairy
elegance of that India embroidery, and your Ladyship
wears a wreath so becoming; wouldn’t gold grapes and
green leaves look tasty, bunches each side with the
di’mond bandeau to draw them together?”</p>

<p>“Pounce, you’re a genius!” Kitty dropped her fan
to clap her hands.</p>

<p>At the same moment my Lord came into the room and
smiled to see her look so pleased.</p>

<p>“Faith, and I’ve come at the right tick of the clock,
I think—morning to you, Miss Pounce. You and my
Lady and your fripperies, ’tis the business of the
world, ain’t it?” He rubbed his hands and hemmed.
“By your bright face, I’ve come at the right tick,
Kitty, me darling, to ask you for a proof of your good
nature.”</p>

<p>“A proof of my good nature, my Lord? So long as
’tis nothing to go against my good sense.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>Kitty was always ready to oblige, in reason, but she
had her wits about her.</p>

<p>“Stay, child,” she cried, as Pamela prepared discreetly
to withdraw. “It can but take a moment. We must
send Pompey for the grapes, to Bond Street, and I vow
that no hand but yours shall fasten them in my curls.
Your niece will write a note, Lydia, at my escritoire, and
see that the black brat runs. They might send a choice
of sizes, what think you, Pamela? <i>Oh, what is it</i>, my
Lord? You men are so impatient.”</p>

<p>“Why, Kitty,” said her husband, coming close to the
sofa, on which his lively little spouse now sat very straight,
gesticulating among the mother-of-pearl shimmer of her
cushions. “The matter concerns you, really, more than
meself. At least, it concerns your family. Poor young
Bellairs has been arrested for debt. Nipped from me
very side, my dear, as we came out of the Cocoa Tree
together, a while ago, by a rascally pimp!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs? Do you refer to Mr. Jocelyn
Bellairs?” asked my Lady Kilcroney, becoming rigid.</p>

<p>Pamela’s quill, scratching wildly across a great sheet
of paper, was arrested in mid flourish.</p>

<p>There was a small unpleasant pause, broken by a
loud sniff from Lydia.</p>

<p>Then my Lady said: “Indeed. I understood the
young gentleman was at Bristol.”</p>

<p>My Lord was not misled by the quietness of her tone.
“Ah, God help you, Kitty,” he exclaimed, flustered.
“Sure you never believed you could keep a lad of that
kidney with his nose in a desk? Didn’t he off with himself
with his first three months’ salary, and hasn’t his
luck been the talk of Bath, barring the let-down of a
sorrel filly at the point-to-point? And sure, if it hadn’t
been that the dice has been going against him the last
three or four days——” he broke off.</p>

<p>Kitty sat like an image of scorn; and my Lord, seeing
that his mission did not seem likely to be blessed with
success, proceeded in nettled tones:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“The long and the short of it is, I’ve promised Jocelyn
we’d see to it. ’Tis only a matter of ninety-seven pound
ten, when all is said and done. And that to a livery
stableman.”</p>

<p>He drew a crumpled sheet of blue paper from
his pocket as he spoke. Kitty unexpectedly stretched
out her hand; with a sigh of relief he put it into
it.</p>

<p>“I knew you’d be the first to say it ought to be paid,
my dearest life.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, it ought to be paid, Denis.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t wish the poor dear lad—and him as
pleasant over the green cloth as ever I met—to be penned
up in the sponging house. Besides which,” added Kilcroney,
in imprudent reminiscence, “don’t I know, isn’t
it the mischief once you get into one of those holes! ’Tis
like a sheep in a ditch: the sky is black with crows after
you in a twinkling.”</p>

<p>“Very sad,” said my Lady.</p>

<p>She tendered the blue paper back with an indifferent
gesture.</p>

<p>“Have you despatched Pompey, Lydia?”</p>

<p>Lord Kilcroney put his hands behind him.</p>

<p>“Nay! nay!” cried he, with the uneasy boisterousness
of one who would force the issue as a joke. “’Tis
your business, me darling.”</p>

<p>“I thought you wanted it paid, my Lord?”</p>

<p>“And maybe,” cried he, laughing yet more violently,
“you think I can pay it?”</p>

<p>He began pulling his pockets out.</p>

<p>“Sure that would be the joke entirely! I’m cleaned
through. There ain’t a single chinker left in my purse,
Kitty, and it’s the lovely red silk one you made me yourself
last Christmas. Troth! I am this moment what
they say Nature abhors——”</p>

<p>“And what’s that, Sir?”</p>

<p>“A vacuum, my love,” quoth my Lord, with a great
guffaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>Kitty contemplated him a moment, icily. Then she
said: “All my sympathies are with Nature.”</p>

<p>Kilcroney reddened, shrugged his shoulders, and
replacing the linings of his pockets in their normal position,
thrust his hands into them, and sauntered out of
the room.</p>

<p>There was nothing further to be done; the moment
was unpropitious.</p>

<p>Kitty balled the blue sheet with an angry hand, and
flung it after him, and Pamela, who had never finished
that phrase of directions, rose from the <i>escritoire</i> and
picked it up.</p>

<p>The action was performed with so much composure that
it seemed but the natural outcome of her good manners.</p>

<p>“Don’t give it back to me, child!” exclaimed Kitty
with tartness. “Throw it into the waste paper basket.
Have you wrote your message?”</p>

<p>Pamela walked back to the writing-table.</p>

<p>“I was un-bethinking myself, your Ladyship, that it
would be better for me to run back myself, and choose
the sprays. Miss Smithson, the person in charge of the
office of a Saturday, is that disagreeable, she’d send the
wrong sets on purpose. It won’t take me half an hour,
my Lady.”</p>

<p>She tore the sheet she had begun writing upon in two,
and dropped it into the elegant little gilt be-ribboned
basket, which was the repository of my Lady Kilcroney’s
scraps. She made a brisk curtsy and stepped out of
the room.</p>

<p>Even Lydia’s sharp eyes failed to perceive that she
had not thrown away the livery-man’s crumpled account;
that she had thrust into her kerchief.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs was not destined to spend the
Sabbath in a sponging house, for he was released on
Saturday night, someone having settled Mr. Thomas
Jobbin’s livery-stable account, before any other of his
creditors had had wind of his arrest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>Now the young gentleman had stepped into liberty
in a very bad humour. He had no doubt but that he
was once again indebted to my Lady Kilcroney in the
matter, but, like many another spendthrift, not having
the smallest claim upon her generosity he considered
that it ought to be unlimited in his regard, and felt himself
injured that it should go no further. He had come to
view himself as having a right to a share of old Bellairs’s
money. Wasn’t he, split him, the last of the name?
Now, was this a way to treat the only living representative
of a Nabob who had left his widow the command
of millions? Just the debt writ off, and not a farthing
over to jingle in your pocket, or a question what was to
become of a fellow! “Never you turn a hair,” had said
my Lord. “I’ll be back again in a jiffy to set you free,
and we’ll have a jolly night of it while my Lady’s at her
caterwaul.”</p>

<p>He had expected no less of one who, like Denis Kilcroney,
was profiting not only of his own uncle’s hoard, but of
that old gentleman’s tactful demise.</p>

<p>But instead of the promised re-appearance a message
had been flung in at him, left by a lackey towards seven
of the clock; my Lord was mortal sorry, and he sent a
bottle of gin and some lemons.</p>

<p>And at ten the prisoner had been told he was free.</p>

<p>Mr. Bellairs had hot blood, and it was all afire. And
the mischief was in it that he might not even have the
satisfaction of calling out the dashed Irishman for his
insolence, since he couldn’t help being under an obligation.</p>

<p>He avoided the Cocoa Tree that evening and plunged
into lower haunts, where, not in the very best company,
play ran very nearly as high as at the Mayfair clubs.</p>

<p>He was an audacious, reckless player, but in the main
a successful one. To-night there was something almost
fantastic in his luck. He went home in the blue of the
morning with his pockets full of gold; his resentful mood
was rather augmented by his good fortune than otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Nor was he in a whit better temper when some five
hours later he swaggered out into the Green Park, shaven
to velvet, his sparrow-tail coat, his high close-fitting
boots, his tight buckskin breeches and their bunches of
ribbon, his short waistcoat, and his big buckled hat, the
very last thing in manly modes. It was his intention to
call upon my Lady Kilcroney in Hertford Street and
repay her the paltry ninety-seven pounds ten which stood
between him and a meeting with my Lord.</p>

<p>Miss Pamela Pounce, coming from church and stepping
in the same direction—she had grown singularly attentive
to Aunt Lydia—came plump upon the Beau as their
paths converged at the Piccadilly gate. His dark face
kindled while her blooming cheek grew pale.</p>

<p>“La, to be sure, sir, who’d ha’ thought of meeting
you?”</p>

<p>“Why, and is it you, Pamela?”</p>

<p>His eye ran her up and down. She was clad in shimmering
blue-lilac taffety, and her wide-brimmed hat, of
the kind which Sir Joshua had set the rage, was trimmed
with broad silk ribbons of the same shade. She wore a
plain muslin kerchief; a black ribbon tied back her unpowdered
chestnut curls. She made a very pleasant
picture; all, with perfect taste, within a certain modest
compass becoming her station.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the emotion evoked in her by
the sight of him. Her breath came quickly; her clear
gaze fluttered and fell, and her pallor was succeeded by
a flame of carnation.</p>

<p>Now out of the black mood in Mr. Bellairs’s soul there
flashed an evil fire.</p>

<p>“Of all the meetings in the whole world,” cried he,
ardently, “there’s none could give me half so much joy,
my dearest creature. Turn with me. I must speak with
you. Nay, Pamela, I vow, I vow, you’ve not been out
of my thoughts this month. Turn and come with me, I
say. Let us away under the trees, where we can talk by
ourselves. Pamela, dearest Pamela, take my arm. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
are more lovely than ever, and I am—I am more headlong
in love than ever I was before!”</p>

<p>There was too great a flutter in the girl’s soul for her
to have her usual cool grip of the situation. An overwhelming
tide of happiness lifted her from her mental
balance. She could not doubt that, after all these
months, it must be a genuine love that lit up his glance,
that trembled in his voice and in his touch She had
proved to him, surely, what kind of girl she was. He
must mean the right thing at last, or he would not so
whole-heartedly declare himself.</p>

<p>And she had just rendered him a signal service, which
(though he could not yet know it), gave her a delightful
sense of meeting him on his own level. She was, moreover,
in a vastly different position now from that of the
mere working milliner. She had resources at her command;
a future before her.</p>

<p>And there he was, the dear fellow, and he loved her
still! Could a Sunday morning in June hold a more
golden bliss?</p>

<p>So she hung on his arm, and listened with parted lips
to his raptures, to the fantastic string of plans, the sweet,
repeated endearments which poured from his lips. Now
that they had met there were to be no more partings.
Things were changed. He had plenty of money. Here
she looked at him in astonishment, and he drew a handful
of gold from his pocket. He was in the Devil’s own vein
of luck, he told her. He wouldn’t listen to her objurgation;
he laughed at the admonishing finger. Her assurance
that she possessed a safer and more worthy source of
wealth he tossed aside as a jest. There was a horse of
his booked for Ascot. If she did not romp in with a
sweet little cottage at Fulham for them both at her
heels!...</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Bellairs!” Pamela clasped her other hand
over his arm. “I could come up and down to business
as easy as easy. A cottage with a bit of garden! ’Tis
the very thing I’ve always dreamed of!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“And I hope you put me in the dream, my lovely
girl.” He kissed her behind the trunk of a big beech-tree.
“Why,” cried he, “who’d have thought to find
you so sensible all at once?”</p>

<p>It was not, perhaps, so much the words, as the way
in which he looked at her after he had kissed her, that
opened the sudden gulf before her! She drew back, and
stood staring; her face haggard; all the lovely bloom
and youthful ecstasy blasted out of it.</p>

<p>Then she said, in a low, strained voice—Pamela went
straight to her point, she was not one to cover ugly
situations with a mince of words—“You don’t mean
marriage, then, Mr. Bellairs?”</p>

<p>The ugliness of his mood sprang into naked prominence.
He broke into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Come, don’t play the prude, now! Don’t pretend
you didn’t understand.” Then he added, a sort of shame
creeping into his accents in spite of himself, “Be
sensible, my dear girl. Don’t play the fool with our lives
again.”</p>

<p>He put out his arm again to embrace her, but she
struck him a vigorous buffet that sent him staggering
from her.</p>

<p>“You’ve laid a vile trap for me, Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs,
but thank God I didn’t fall into it! I see you now as you
are, a low, selfish scamp that doesn’t think it shame to
take his pleasure on other people. You’d drag my good
name into the dust with as little concern as you live on
my Lady’s money. So long as you get your fling you
don’t care who you rob or what you destroy! Oh,
I’m glad to have seen you as you are! And good
morning to you, Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs, for a very paltry
dog!”</p>

<p>She swept him a curtsy which was magnificent in
its repudiation. He had a swift vision of her scorching
eyes, her scarlet cheeks; she turned and left him, dumbfounded.</p>

<p>“I’m done with love,” said Pamela Pounce, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
herself. “May I never hear of it, or see it, or touch it
again!”</p>

<p>Little did she guess with what overwhelming passion
she was very shortly destined to behold the cruel god at
work upon another life!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In Which Miss Pamela Pounce Sets Three Black<br>
Feathers for Tragedy</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Pamela Pounce</span> was in the act of tying on her own
hat, in the upper room, preparatory to departure after
the day’s work, when a breathless junior summoned
her.</p>

<p>“There’s a young lady below as wants to see you,
Miss Pounce, and, la! I think ’tis Miss Falcon!”</p>

<p>Now, Felicity Falcon had recently flashed out upon
the London stage with a startling and unexpected splendour
that was more like that of a comet than of a star;
Miss Farren, Mrs. Siddons, Mrs. Jordan, were for the
moment as idols overthrown. The cry was all for Falcon.
Her name was on every man’s lips. She was the first
excitement of the season; and not the opera, not an
oratorio, not a concert, not a rout at Almack’s, nor a
display at Ranelagh, could be said to offer attraction in
comparison to the playhouse which announced the fair
Falcon in the night’s performance.</p>

<p>On hearing this remarkable name, Pamela paused, her
hand on the black velvet string which fastened her simple
Dunstable straw under her round, white chin. A play-actress!
Many a young person of that profession had
Miss Pounce with dignity shown forth already from the
doors of this select establishment: “Much regretting,
Madame, that there is nothing likely to suit you here.”</p>

<p>Heavens, if a Mirabel hat were to be recognised on the
boards! But Felicity Falcon? It was only last week
that Pamela had wept and trembled, and sucked in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
breaths of excitement over her “Mrs. Haller.” Never
had she beheld anything more affecting, more impassioned,
soul-stirring, and elegant than that impersonation.</p>

<p>To provide Miss Falcon with a hat in which she would
enthral and ravish all London! It was too splendid
an opportunity for such an artistic soul as that of Pamela
to resist. After hours, too, and the shutters putting up,
and no fear of awkward rencounters. And if some of
her ladies did find it out, why, foh! for one that
would be offended, forty would order a hat to the same
model.</p>

<p>Pamela flung the Dunstable straw off her chestnut
head, and turning with great dignity, “Inform Miss
Falcon,” said she, “that I will attend her presently.”</p>

<p>After a due delay, which she spent in drumming with
white fingers on the dressing-table, her eyes lost beyond
her own reflection, in a far vision of millinery genius,
Madame Mirabel’s partner appeared in the empty shop;
sedate, her eyebrows well elevated into her white forehead,
her hands folded on her trim waistband.</p>

<p>The slender figure in the brown silk cloak turned
quickly with a rustle and flutter.</p>

<p>“You was wishful to speak with me, Madam?”
questioned Miss Pounce, in her finest business manner.</p>

<p>“I want a hat for to-night, for Lady Teazle—for the
third act, for the screen scene. Oh, I want something——”</p>

<p>Miss Pounce raised her hand.</p>

<p>“One moment, Madam.”</p>

<p>She gazed at the narrow, pale face, unrouged; the
dark, ardent eyes.</p>

<p>“’Tis the most mortal-genteel creature I have ever
seen,” thought Pamela.</p>

<p>“Not a word, Miss Falcon!” cried she. Then in the
tone of a sibyl: “Black and white; or yet all white.
But if you listen to me, black <i>and</i> white.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no time to get any new gowns for the part,” said
Miss Falcon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>She had a slow, musical voice, with a ring in it as of
tears never far off, yet never to be shed.</p>

<p>“And if you’ll excuse me, Miss,” repeated the milliner,
“Lady Teazle’s not your part, so to speak.
Tragedy, that’s what you’re born to. Oh, your Mrs.
Haller!” Pamela drew a sucking breath in reminiscence
of last week’s thrills. “There! I’d never ask to enjoy
anything more. Cry, I did. I couldn’t see out of my
two eyes, I vow and protest, when I came forth out of
the theatre. But if it’s got to be Lady Teazle, Madame,
’tis your one bit of tragedy I’m to dress your head for,
as I understand it. And put colour on it—I declare I’d
as soon stick a pink rosette on that there goddess with
the lamp from Greece his Grace of Hampshire sets so
much store by in his hall. Put yourself into white for
it, Miss Falcon, and I’ll do you a hat that’ll show it off
and you. When all’s said and done, ’twill be a symbol
of what an innocent, poor young lady you are, so took in
by that lying young gentleman, what I’d hiss off the
boards every time he shows his vile, deceitful face, if I’d
my will! La! men are base creatures,” cried Pamela
out of her own bitterness. “White for your innocence,
and the shadow of my broad brim over your eyes with
a toss of white feathers atop, and just three black plumes
standing up in the midst of them; the bit of tragedy
that has come into your young life; one,” said Miss
Pounce, “for the horrid danger you’ve escaped, and one
for your poor deceived heart, and one for the remorse,
like, over the goodness of that kind Sir Peter, making his
will so generous and trusting, for all his ways ’ud be
enough to drive any wife out of her wits. Those black
feathers,” said the girl impressively, “will show you
off, Miss Falcon, better than trumpet blasts.”</p>

<p>Miss Falcon listened with an odd, abstracted look.</p>

<p>“So you think I’m best in tragedy, do you?” she
said, and sighed. “But I don’t want to be tragic, I
want to be happy.” And then: “I’m late!” she
cried impetuously. “You’ll have to bring me the hat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
to the theatre. I’ve scarce the time to get into my
clothes.”</p>

<p>A handsome private coach, with liveried footmen, was
waiting for her at the door, and as Pamela accompanied
her to the threshold, the actress looked back over her
shoulder with a fugitive smile:</p>

<p>“I’ll wear a white satin gown for the screen scene,”
she said, stepped into the coach, and was whirled
away.</p>

<p>Pamela stood looking after her.</p>

<p>“Now who’s paying for all that?” the milliner asked
herself. “Some very great personage, ’tis well known;
for anything more splendid and discreet I never see.
Best in tragedy, you poor thing!” The tears rose to
Pamela’s candid eyes. “Why, ’tis tragedy itself you
are already! You so young, with that smile that ought
to have warmed a good man’s heart! La, if my ladies
knew who ’tis I’m going to trim a hat for this minute,
and where ’tis I’m to bring it when ’tis done!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Pamela Pounce looked about her with shrewd eyes,
as she sat, very politely, on the edge of a cane chair in
Miss Falcon’s dressing-room at Drury Lane. A bandbox
at her feet, her hands folded one across the other in her
dove-grey lap, she presented the very image of elegant
propriety in a doubtful atmosphere. She had not
expected to find company in the dressing-room, the play
being well started; nevertheless, there was a knot of
two or three modish-looking individuals who laughed a
good deal together, and tapped the lids of their own
snuff-boxes and took pinches out of each other’s with
positively the last thing in flourishes.</p>

<p>The gaunt woman who moved about at the back of the
dressing-table, unnecessarily shaking garments, was,
of course, the actress’s dresser, and a sour piece she was,
thought Pamela, who had already refused, with a high
air of contempt, this functionary’s proposal to leave the
bandbox with her. “As if I was come all this way to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
porter’s work!” thought Miss Pounce, with a toss of
her admirably tired head.</p>

<p>Miss Falcon was standing at the door, looking in upon
them, before anyone was aware of her presence; then she
came forward, followed by a portly, handsome gentleman
past middle age, at sight of whom the gossips bowed to
a most obsequious depth.</p>

<p>Miss Falcon bore still upon her countenance the
humorous peevishness of the character she had just
represented.</p>

<p>“Why, how now?” she exclaimed. “Fie, for shame,
gentlemen! What are you doing here? If you desire
to show me a compliment your place is before the curtain,
sirs! Foh! ’Tis a poor compliment to salute an actress
in her dressing-room!”</p>

<p>“Why, my dearest creature!” exclaimed the chief of
the fops, coming forward, and bowing repeatedly with
such an affected parade of courtesy that Pamela’s hand
itched to box his ears. “I vow and declare we are but
mustering all our energies to acclaim you after your
great scene! We would not spoil that effect, ’pon our
life! Not for a hundred thousand guineas! What’s
Lady Teazle before the screen scene? No part for your
genius, incomparable Falcon!”</p>

<p>“Out with you now, then!” said Miss Falcon. “Good
evening, Miss Pounce. Oh, gentlemen, gentlemen, indeed
you cannot remain here! Miss Pounce and I have the
most important business on hand. La, that bandbox!
It is vastly good of you, Miss Pounce. Pray, my Lord,
give the gentlemen the lead and take them to their seats!”</p>

<p>“Rat me!” said the spokesman of the fashionable
group, looking round with what Pamela thought was a
very offensive leer. “If my Lord Harborough sets the
example, who are we that we should refuse to follow it?
After you, my Lord Marquis.”</p>

<p>Pamela had often heard the name of the great Marquis,
especially of late, but she had never yet seen him. She
now gazed at him with shrewd eyes of disapproval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“Ah, my Lord, you may have a fine taste in coaches
and in the horses to draw them, and a superlative
delicate taste in play-actresses, but to my mind ’tis
mortal poor taste to be bringing those grey hairs that are
under your wig, and an honoured name, and all your
privilege to the undoing of one poor girl! You should
keep that smile for your grand-nephews—Mr. W.’s
brats—you should indeed, my Lord!”</p>

<p>My Lord Harborough raised himself from a profound
bow over the hand which Felicity Falcon extended to him
in a careless sort of way, more as if she were dropping
something out of it than yielding it to his caress. The
smile he gave her as he straightened himself was full of
ardent admiration. Although he failed to meet with her
favour, Pamela could not but admit that he had a very
splendid presence, and that any woman’s head, much less
that of a young player on her promotion, might well be
turned by receiving attention from such a quarter.</p>

<p>My Lord Marquis now waved the company from the
room with a politely compelling gesture, as of a host who
bids his guests pass before him; kissed his hand to Miss
Falcon, and himself departed.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear girl, my dear girl, the hat!” cried she,
turning upon Pamela.</p>

<p>And Pamela had the strange thought that Miss Falcon—even
though she had stepped off the boards—had not
ceased acting for one single moment, and that no emotion
had been more cleverly counterfeited than the playfulness
with which she was now herself addressed.</p>

<p>Indeed, when Felicity Falcon first contemplated her
countenance in the mirror under that confection in which
Miss Pounce considered her own genius had reached its
most perfect expression, so deep an air of tragedy spread
itself over her features that the sprightly milliner thought
in dismay, “Heaven be good to me; to see her one would
think my lovely feathers were crowning a hearse!”</p>

<p>But as if she guessed her companion’s thoughts, the
play-actress instantly resumed a jocund air, and, twisting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
her head from side to side, treated her own reflection to
smiles of different meanings, as though testing their
effect; mischief, archness, innocent mirth, mockery,
melancholy, chased each other across her fair countenance
like shadows over a pool, and in each Miss Pounce could
have cried out to her to stay it, vowing that she was more
perfect in it than the last.</p>

<p>Indeed, the delicate loveliness set in the flying powdered
curls, crowned with the soft splendour of the feathers,
marked, so to speak, by the three notes of black, was a
vision worth gazing upon. The sheen of the white satin
she had chosen for her robe flung up the ivory of her
shoulders and throat. Miss Pounce almost regretted to
see the obligatory smear of rouge put on each pale cheek;
by which, however, the lily fairness gained something
exotic, feverish, that seemed to match very well with the
swift passion of her art.</p>

<p>“It’ll be such a Lady Teazle as never was,” thought
the milliner; and was wondering whether she could yet
find a seat for herself in the theatre, when, turning
suddenly dark, haunted eyes upon her, Miss Falcon said
like a child:</p>

<p>“Oh, do let me find you here when I come back, you
kind thing!” and, without giving Madame Mirabel’s
head woman time to reply, she added: “I know you will,”
and whisked back to the dressing-table.</p>

<p>Her hand hovered over a closed jewel-case, then,
shrugging her shoulders, she drew out a string of pearls
and clasped it round her throat.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was strange for Pamela presently to sit alone in the
little dressing-room and think of the mimic play of
emotion, clash of passion and interest that was enthralling
so many scores of spectators within a few yards of her;
to think, too, of that drama of real life, so sad and shameful,
of which she had unexpectedly become a witness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>It was contrary to her vivacious nature to sit, unoccupied
and in patience, while the world swept on its
way, but to-night she had much to engross her thoughts.
All she had seen pointed to courses which, to her straight
judgment, could not but appear as evil. Yet if ever,
thought Pamela Pounce, there was delicacy and purity
stamped on a human countenance, if ever noble pride,
it was on the face of the young play-actress.</p>

<p>“Why did she ask me to remain?” puzzled the girl.
“If my Lord Harborough is her protector, as he seems to
be, what does she want with a poor, honest milliner?
Oh, la! to see her, so beautiful, with them pearls, and to
know what it means, I could fair cry!”</p>

<p>Miss Falcon’s dresser came rushing in, declaring that
there never had been such a success as the new Lady
Teazle; that the house had had her out again and again.
“And, oh, my goodness, the shouts and claps and nose-gays
flying! What a pity Miss had not been in the
gallery!”</p>

<p>Before Pamela had time to reply Miss Falcon herself,
accompanied by a very conspicuous group of admirers,
returned to her dressing-room. Her flush outdid the
rouge, her eyes flashed. The tips of her taper fingers
rested on Lord Harborough’s wrist, and he came in
leading her with an air as though her triumph belonged
to him. Behind her the sycophants gabbled, “for all
the world like father’s geese,” thought Miss Pounce.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Lord, she is incomparable!” “I do assure
you, Miss Falcon, when the screen was knocked down
and you stood forth I could have fallen on my knees
before you!” “’Pon honour! ’Pon honour, never was
acting half so fine!”</p>

<p>The flush was fading, and the fire dying in her gaze as
she turned round upon them.</p>

<p>“Pray, gentlemen, you are very kind, but I have to
change my gown for the next act. My Lord, bid your
friends leave me. And you too, my Lord.”</p>

<p>As bowing, kissing hands, grimacing, jostling against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
each other, the little knot of gossips withdrew, obedient
once more to their patron’s wave, he himself lingered.</p>

<p>“Felicity,” he said, “there never was anyone like you.
My dear, you brought the tears to my eyes.”</p>

<p>When he released her hand there was a new ring upon
it. The donor hurried forth, as if, with the finest tact,
to forego gratitude in connection with a trifle, or so Miss
Pounce understood his magnificent mien.</p>

<p>Felicity gazed at the object on her hand, gave a
laugh which rang scornful, dropped the jewel from
her on the dressing-table, and sat down before the
mirror.</p>

<p>“Now,” said she to Pamela, “take off the hat yourself,
if you will. My dresser hath so gross a touch. The hat,
you know, it has made me to-night. I owe you a vast
debt of gratitude. Oh, those black feathers! Your
excellent taste, child, gave the note, I do assure you, to
my whole rendering. The tragedy, you know, and the
innocence, and the remorse.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Pamela as if she were mocking herself
as she gazed upon her own countenance. She broke off.
There was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she cried. And, as a young gentleman in
mourning, with a pale face, appeared in the aperture,
she went on in an unchanged voice: “How would it be,
Miss Pounce, if I were to run a blue ribbon among these
curls? ’Twould not come amiss, I think, in the last act,
to mark the girlishness of Lady Teazle beside so old a
husband. Now, my Lord, pray be quick about your
business. I have scarce five minutes to give you! Yes,
a blue ribbon, I think. You have such charming fingers,
my dear, pray pass it in yourself. Go on, my Lord, I can
see you very well in the glass, and sure, besides, I did not
promise to look at you, so long as I listen.”</p>

<p>“You mean to torture me,” said the young man in
a low voice.</p>

<p>Had he been on the rack, Pamela thought, glancing
compassionately at his reflection, as her hands moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
delicately in the actress’s tresses, he could scarce have
had a greater air of suffering.</p>

<p>“Pho!” cried Miss Falcon. (“Is not that a trifle too
forward, Miss Pounce?”) “Pray, my Lord, remember,
this interview is none of my seeking.”</p>

<p>“I asked to speak with you alone.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but I did not promise you that! Say out, or
keep silence, it matters nothing to me.”</p>

<p>“I begin to believe what I have heard,” he exclaimed
hoarsely.</p>

<p>Her eye flashed lightning at his image in the glass.</p>

<p>“Indeed, my Lord? And that again leaves me indifferent.”</p>

<p>But as she spoke she turned round on her chair. What
a marvel of loveliness she was, thought the milliner.
’Twas but natural any poor young gentleman that loved
her should be distraught upon her. He gazed on her
wildly, then broke out, clasping his hands:</p>

<p>“Nay,” he cried. “I will not believe it. I will not
believe it, unless you tell me yourself. Felicity, my
father is dead. I am my own master. Look at me.
Behold this black. I came straight—yes, I am not
ashamed of it—straight from the closing of my father’s
grave to offer you my hand and name.”</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>“I ought, no doubt, to be overwhelmed at your
generosity. A month ago you were no less ardent, if I
remember right, in pressing a different proposition,” she
said very quietly.</p>

<p>Pamela’s heart quickened in passionate sympathy.
What a world was this for poor girls!</p>

<p>“It’s not possible,” the young gentleman cried, “that
you will carry rancour so far! A month ago I was not
a free agent; a month ago I—oh, confusion! You
cannot have understood. I—Miss Falcon, I am now
Earl Ashmore, and I ask you to become my countess.
This is a question of marriage. You cannot thus lightly
dismiss so honourable, so respectful an offer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“Marriage!” she laughed. “I, too, am a free agent,
sir, and I have tasted liberty longer than you. I have
no desire to relinquish it.”</p>

<p>A moment he stood gazing at her with clenched hands
and open mouth, as if unable to grasp the extent of her
folly and his own misery. Then he snapped his jaws
together and crimsoned to the roots of his lightly powdered
hair.</p>

<p>“It’s true, then?”</p>

<p>“What is true?”</p>

<p>“What all the world says; that you’re my Lord
Harborough’s—my Lord Harborough’s——”</p>

<p>He choked upon the word.</p>

<p>Pamela Pounce held her breath in the dreadful silence
that ensued. Then:</p>

<p>“Don’t be a foolish lad,” said Miss Falcon in a changed
kind voice. “One day you’ll say, ‘Whatever the player
woman may have done, she did one good deed to me.
She wouldn’t marry me when I was fool enough to ask
her.’”</p>

<p>Then Felicity turned back to the mirror with a laugh
that rang like tinkling icicles, so musical it was, so cold.</p>

<p>The wretched young man cast himself on his knees,
lifted his clasped hands and wrung them. He had forgotten
that there was any witness, save the one who was,
at that moment, all the world to him.</p>

<p>“Felicity, I don’t care what you have done—what you
are to that bad old man. I will forgive everything.
Come to me and be my wife!”</p>

<p>“Now, Bonnets, open the door. Miss Pounce, pray
put a hand upon my Lord’s elbow and help him to rise.
That is the way out, my Lord Ambrose. (I cannot help
it. I remember best the name under which you once
insulted me.) <i>You</i> forgive me? Had I the time I could
laugh. Heavens! But three minutes to get into the
paduasoy!”</p>

<p>She did laugh as the young nobleman, a look on his
face which struck a kind of terror into Pamela’s womanly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
heart, flung his hands out with a menace and dashed
from the room.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, the creature’s gone! Bolt the door,
Mrs. Bonnets. I’ll have no more visitors till the play’s
over!”</p>

<p>Pamela Pounce was not bidden remain this time; but
she could not bring herself to leave the dressing-room
until Miss Falcon’s last appearance there. Talk of plays!
What a tremendous play she had seen that night. ’Twould
be like walking out before the last curtain dropped to go
home now.</p>

<p>When the actress returned she was accompanied only by
Lord Harborough. As he led her in he looked at her hand.</p>

<p>“I see,” he said, “you have not honoured my poor
gift.”</p>

<p>“My Lord,” she said, “I have honoured you sixty-five
times with these pearls. Is it not enough? As for
rings, there is a slave weight about them. I hate them.
But is this really mine? Mine to do as I will with?”</p>

<p>He smiled at each question, and Pamela thought that,
for all his fond admiration, there was a sort of contemptuous
indulgence lurking in his glance—that he had
the air of one who says to himself, “These pretty tricks
are known; these charming moods are part of the little
game. I have not the enthusiasm of youth, but I have
experience, I have toleration, and I have patience!”</p>

<p>“It is an elegant and artistic ring,” said Miss Falcon,
lifting it to the light of the wax candles which branched
from her mirror. “A sapphire, I see, and all chased.”</p>

<p>“It was found,” said Lord Harborough, “in a Roman
tomb. There is not another like it in the world!”</p>

<p>“And what does it represent? Oh, I see snakes about
that strange little face!”</p>

<p>“’Tis a Medusa head.”</p>

<p>“What?” she cried. “What an ill omen for an
actress! How terrible if I were to turn my audience to
stone. Fie, I would not keep such a thing about me for
the world! Pray, Miss Pounce, will you accept this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
trifle in memory of our first acquaintance and of, oh,
your beautiful hat! How kind of you, dear girl, to stay
and see the last of me. Why, it just fits your finger!
Nay, I will take no refusal. My cloak, Bonnets! La,
I am mortal tired. Pray, my Lord, good night. Well,
as far as the coach then, but no further. Remember
our compact!”</p>

<p>“As far as the coach,” said the peer, with his disillusioned
smile. “As far as the coach at least, lovely
mystery, beautiful secret! Oh, the Medusa head would
have been vastly appropriate, I assure you!”</p>

<p>They went forth, and Pamela Pounce stared at her
ring. She had never felt, in all her varied energetic
existence, thus puzzled and troubled.</p>

<p>“Heaven ha’ mercy,” she thought, “what a prodigious
bit of insolence, to give it to me under his very nose!
And, oh, lud, what’s a body to think? Will he marry
her after all and my poor Miss Sarah and Mr. W. be cut
out? She wears his pearls and drives in his coach, and
yet withal he’s to lead her no further than its door!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“’Tis the most dreadful tale, child, that’s current,”
said my Lady Kilcroney to her friend, Nan Day, as they
met in Madame Mirabel’s hat shop. “They say my
young Lord Ashmore has put an end to himself. I met
the Duke of Hampshire anon, and His Grace could scarce
speak, so overwhelmed was he. Lord Ashmore’s father
was his friend and neighbour.”</p>

<p>Pamela Pounce put down the dove-coloured capote
she had been about to place upon Lady Anne Day’s pretty
head. She was more affected than her customer, who
looked up, knitting her brows vaguely, with small
interest in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Ashmore?”</p>

<p>“Why, Nan, he that was young Ambrose! A pretty
youth, and full of promise. It seems he was mad in love
with Falcon, the actress. Did you see her Lady Teazle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
last night? ’Twas a wonder, my love, but a thought too
solemn. But, oh, Pounce, child, she had a hat! You
should have seen it! With all your art, you’ve never
dreamt one like it. Eglantine, Eglantine at her best.
Paris was stamped all over it. When all is said and done
there is naught like the French taste.”</p>

<p>“I have always said so, my Lady,” responded Miss
Pounce, “and there’s a case upstairs full of the real Paris
modes, of which I’d like your Ladyship to have her pick
this moment! Perhaps the last consignment we’ll get for
goodness knows how long, seeing the trouble over there.
Fetched at the Dover coach office by our special messenger
not half an hour ago, I do assure your Ladyship.”</p>

<p>Pamela could control her voice better than her
hands, and the professional patter escaped her almost
mechanically.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t seen how the capote suits me,” protested
Nan Day, a little pettishly. “Kitty, what say you?
I’ve been so long in the fields. I was scarce fit to go out
in a chair at Bath, so worn was I with the sick-nursing,”
complained the squire’s wife, “I have positively forgot
what a fashion looks like. Sister Susan promised to
meet me here and advise—not indeed that I care for my
Lady Verney’s taste. You are ten thousand times better,
my dearest Kitty. Pray give me your opinion.”</p>

<p>“My love,” said Kitty, “in all sober earnest I am too
overset to be able to give my mind to it as I ought. That
unfortunate young man! It seems Lord Harborough
cast him out of her dressing-room last night, and there
was a monstrous great scandal at the theatre door. The
wretched girl, my Lord Harborough——”</p>

<p>“And what, my Lady, have you heard of it already?”
said a masculine voice behind her. And all started to
behold Lord Verney in their midst. “I thought I
was the first to have wind of it, coming straight from
Brooks’s. ’Tis scarce an hour since he was picked up
unconscious.”</p>

<p>“Never say,” cried my Lady Kilcroney in horror,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
“that he had so little discretion as to choose a club for
such an act.”</p>

<p>Lord Verney stared.</p>

<p>“Why, Madame, you speak as if the poor Marquis had
had any choice in the matter?”</p>

<p>“The poor Marquis? In Heaven’s name, collect your
wits. ’Tis not Lord Harborough who has committed
suicide?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, my Lady Kilcroney, the idea is sprung
entirely from your own imagination. Lord Harborough’s
illness is a fit. He had scarce interchanged a few words
with a friend in the club-room when he groaned and fell
forward. Sir Richard Jebb and Dr. Jenner were at once
summoned. They could not get the blood to flow. He
was still breathing, that was all.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis another old sinner gone to his account,”
said Nan Day philosophically. “And Sarah W. is a
Marchioness—who’d have thought it? Where is Susan?
I’m not sure, Miss Pounce, that I really care for a capote.
Could you not let me see some of those French hats you
spoke of anon?”</p>

<p>“Ah, Nan, you have indeed sadly lost touch with the
world, child! ’Twas a magnificent fine gentleman, a
noble patron of literature and art——”</p>

<p>“Ay, and of the stage, by your own showing, Kitty.”
Nan Day spoke smartly. “Pray, Miss Pounce, did you
not hear me?”</p>

<p>Pamela felt sick and faint. She was glad enough of
the excuse to crawl away and take a dose of the hartshorn
which was kept handy in the workroom in hot weather.
When she returned to the showroom to announce that
the case was at that moment being opened—her head
girl was wrapping all last week’s inspirations carefully
in tissue for the occasion—she found the company increased
by My Lady Verney and Mrs. Lafone, and that
well-known personage, Beau Stafford. He was speaking
as she entered, and the first words that caught her ear
were these:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“I call her Fair Fatality.”</p>

<p>Mistress Molly Lafone’s shrill accents were then uplifted.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Stafford,” though she was sister-in-law to
the Beau there was small love lost between them, “granting
the suicide—to be sure, the poor young man must
have been mad—you cannot hold Miss Falcon responsible
for Lord Harborough’s seizure.”</p>

<p>“You know a good deal, Mistress Molly, but you don’t
know everything. Young Lord Ashmore attacked the
Marquis in the street last night. There was a terrible
scene between them. Ay, ladies, all on account of that
wild bird, the Falcon. Lord Harborough had to call to
his footmen—fact, I assure you! Only for the scandal he
would have handed his assailant to the watch. ’Twas
the shock of hearing of the rash youth’s dreadful end,
this morning, that has been the death of him. Ay, My
Lord Harborough is dead. They were pulling down the
blinds of Harborough House as I passed along the Mall.”</p>

<p>“Fair Fatality, indeed!” cried Kitty. “And her
so young and handsome, and not a six months famous
yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s a cunning piece!” interposed Molly. “I
have heard tales of her ways. They say none knows
where she lives, nor where she comes from, nor her real
name. She wraps herself in the utmost mystery. Probably,”
went on the little lady, with her acid titter, “’tis
some grocer’s daughter! But poor simplicity has no
chance, especially with the gentlemen. You must play
the romantick.”</p>

<p>My Lady Kilcroney, her fingers to her lips, seemed lost
in reflection.</p>

<p>“Was there not a story of a duel, Mr. Stafford?”</p>

<p>“A duel, Madam? Five, to my certain knowledge,”
asseverated the Beau. “And all with more or less
serious results.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, ’tis like an Italian tale of the evil eye!”
Nan shuddered. “I’ll not go to Drury Lane and come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
under it, ’tis pos! <i>Pray, Miss Pounce? Oh, no, not
green! Green! Am I never to get away from it?</i>”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Falcon’s fame did not suffer from the double
tragedy of which she had been so singularly the cause.
She withdrew from the programmes for a week after the
funerals of the two unfortunate noblemen, and then
reappeared, to play to houses more crowded, more enthusiastic
than ever. The wild rumours which began
to circulate about her only served to increase the public
frenzy.</p>

<p>Pamela Pounce, much occupied with the Walsingham
mourning, was for some time unable to gratify her desire
to see Fair Fatality act once more; a desire which—so
far was she from sharing Lady Anne Day’s fears—had
now indeed become a kind of obsession. When circumstances
permitted her at last to indulge herself, she
purchased a ticket in the forefront of the gallery, and
prepared to enjoy a couple of hours complicated emotion.
To her amazement, at the end of the second act a note
was handed to her:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>I have just seen your kind face. Will you be a
Friend to me to-night, and come back with me to my
house? If you can do me this favour—my heart tells
me you will—meet me at the stage door after the last act.</i></p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Felicity Falcon.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>At any time the adventure was one likely to tempt a
girl of Pamela’s spirit. In present circumstances, wrought
to the highest pitch of excitement and interest by the
emotions of the drama and the personality of the young
play-actress, the invitation came to her as the magic
fulfilment of a dream. Although never had Miss Falcon’s
acting been more poignant, more intense in passion and
tragedy, the milliner could hardly wait for the drop of
the curtain, so eager was she to enter upon what she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
could not avoid considering the more thrilling drama
still.</p>

<p>The crowds that packed the theatre were so immense,
and the determination to recall the favourite so obstinate
and prolonged, that it was after considerable delay that
Pamela found herself at last at the stage door.</p>

<p>An elegant, sober-looking carriage, with servants in
dark liveries, stood in waiting, and just behind it a
hackney coach.</p>

<p>Miss Falcon, hooded and cloaked, escorted by a group
of gentlemen, stepped forward and took her hand.</p>

<p>“I knew you would come,” she whispered. Her
manner was preoccupied. “This is no place for introductions,”
she went on, turning to her escort. “Since
it must be, let us even start.”</p>

<p>“Sheridan,” said one who walked in advance of the
others, one, indeed, whom the milliner, with a thumping
heart, scarce dared recognise as the heir to the throne,
“you accompany the ladies.”</p>

<p>The two women drew back while he passed somewhat
unsteadily out of the theatre, and was, with discreet bows,
ushered to his carriage by all the gentlemen of the party,
a single member of which then followed him in. The
carriage, evidently to order, moved a few paces up the
street and again halted, while the hackney was drawn
to the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Sheridan, followed by the other gentlemen, now
came back. He offered his right arm to Miss Falcon,
and, with some exaggeration of ceremony, which his
companions seemed to find humorous, his left to Miss
Pounce. After he had handed the ladies into the hackney
coach, he paused, laughing at the door.</p>

<p>“What address shall I say, sweet Falcon?” He
raised his voice, as for the benefit of those behind him.
“Now for the great disclosure!” he cried.</p>

<p>Fair Fatality had a cold smile. Pamela could see her
face by the light of the links each side of the theatre
portals. It was very pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Pray get in, sir,” she said; “the man knows his
way.”</p>

<p>As they drove off Mr. Sheridan rubbed his hands and
laughed again.</p>

<p>“To think that I should be sitting <i>vis-à-vis</i> to the
fairest intrigue in all London, and actually be going to
solve the mystery! Though, to be sure, ’tis no mystery
to you, ma’am, I dare swear?”</p>

<p>He looked tentatively at Pamela through the gloom.</p>

<p>They were turning out of a by-street into the main
thoroughfare, and Pamela, casting her glance out of the
window, was startled, but scarcely surprised, to see that
the Prince’s carriage was very closely following theirs.</p>

<p>“Why, Pamela, my girl,” said the milliner to herself,
“little you thought when you set out that you’d perhaps
be supping with Royalty! But there’s one thing clear.
You’ve got to stand by this poor soul to-night.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sheridan did not seem to relish the idea of conversation
with Miss Falcon’s companion. Pamela, who
from the first had fancied that, though carrying his liquor
with decorum, he was far from sober, was not sorry to see
him fall into a doze. Whether on her side the actress
were asleep or not she could not guess, but she never
moved nor spoke. The drive was long, and Pamela had
lost all her sense of district when the coach was pulled
up at last. But Mr. Sheridan, waking with a start and
looking eagerly about him, cried:</p>

<p>“Why, this is the King’s Road! I’ll be hanged if
that’s not the lodge of Elm Park House.”</p>

<p>“This, sir,” said Miss Falcon, “is Mulberry House,
my poor abode, to which you are——” she paused, and
altered her phrase—“where I am this night privileged
to receive you.”</p>

<p>Pamela understood she would not bid them welcome.
At the same moment the royal carriage halted in its turn;
but Miss Falcon, alighting, did not pause to pay the
respect etiquette demanded. She pushed open the gate,
and went quickly across the flagged courtyard towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
the little house which stood square and solid, with pedimented
portico, before them.</p>

<p>As Pamela hurried after she saw that a light shone
through the cracks of the shuttered ground floor windows.
Miss Falcon inserted a key in the lock and opened the
house door. She drew Pamela into an oak-panelled
hall, dimly lit with a couple of candles in a silver candelabra,
and herself stood in the aperture.</p>

<p>She dropped a profound curtsy as the Prince appeared,
followed by Mr. Sheridan and that other gentleman
whom Pamela supposed to be the equerry-in-waiting.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, sir,” her voice was low and tired, and
it struck Pamela that something had gone out of it—the
fire and thrill and youthful pathos that had made it every
moment an appeal—“that you should have such a poor
reception. Since I was not prepared for the honour,
since it was your pleasure to surprise me by this favour,
I must beg you to take me as I am. There are no servants
here to-night.”</p>

<p>She moved backwards as she spoke. Theatrical
training stood her in good stead. The movement was
perfect.</p>

<p>“Will you condescend to enter? Mr. Sheridan, pray
close the door behind His Highness.”</p>

<p>She preceded the Prince, still backing easily, to a parlour
on the right of the entrance. It was a small, gay
apartment, panelled in white, with double doors leading
apparently into an inner room. Four candles on the
centre table, burning rather low in their sockets, gave a
fairly sufficient light.</p>

<p>Pamela, who slipped in, with some timidity, in the
wake of the party, perceived their hostess’s face to be
deathly pale, and hurried to her side.</p>

<p>Miss Falcon caught her hand with an ice-cold grip.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the portly, elderly gentleman,
who once for his charm and youthful grace had been
known as Prince Florizel, looked discomfited to confoundment
by the unexpected strangeness of the situation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
His two companions stared at each other. The sobriety
they all three needed seemed to be returning to them.</p>

<p>“Will your Highness condescend to take a chair?”</p>

<p>Still holding the milliner’s warm hand the play-actress
stood erect.</p>

<p>“Sir, it has been your pleasure to command the
revelation of a secret which concerned only my humble
person. I understand even that you have honoured me
so far as to make my insignificance the object of a wager.
I trust I am too obedient a subject to disobey my future
Sovereign, too loyal not to assist him in the gratification
of his sporting instincts. With the more readiness,
indeed, that at four o’clock this afternoon my reason for
wishing to keep my unimportant identity, my unobtrusive
abode from the knowledge of the world has ceased to
exist——”</p>

<p>She broke off.</p>

<p>Not more intently had the mighty audience hung upon
her lips to-night than did now these four, her oddly
entertained guests. Pamela’s heart beat high. She felt
herself as on the very edge of some fathomless chasm of
tragedy.</p>

<p>“Your Royal Highness,” went on Felicity Falcon, her
sweet voice hoarse, “since it is your pleasure to know it,
my name is Gwenlian Morgan. I am the wife——” A
spasm crossed her face. She caught her breath, and
went on: “I married one Evan Morgan, a Welsh preacher.
Ours has been a great love; but with him God was always
first. He believed he had a call to London. We left the
fair hills and our cottage for these dreadful streets.
He failed. He fell into a decline. We had hardly any
money left. He could work no more, and he would not
take charity. I had to earn for him. How? I had
to earn much and quickly or he would die. There was
only one way, and that way anathema to him. To his
pure and lofty mind the stage was always ruin and
damnation!”</p>

<p>Again there was a brief silence. The equerry tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
to whisper to Mr. Sheridan, but that good-hearted
gentleman gave him an angry scowl. The Prince sat
breathing hard, his eyes fixed, his mouth slightly open.</p>

<p>“There was but one way in which I could earn much
and quickly. I took it. I took it in secret. I began
low. Fortune favoured me. I was noticed behind the
scenes by one whose notice meant advancement. Yes,
sir”—she flashed a dark look at the equerry, who murmured
a name—“my Lord Harborough was a generous
patron; and then all came easy. At home I had but to
lie. Good heavens, how I lied and plotted and contrived
and deceived! But what did anything matter?
There was no crime save unfaithfulness to my Beloved
that I would not have committed for his sake. I told
him I had inherited a fortune. I kept him almost from
the first in comfort. When I was able to hire this house
I told him I had sold out funds to do so. He believed
me. He trusted me. He would as soon have thought of
doubting an angel, as of doubting me. And so I—hoodwinked
him. It was the easier that he had to keep
to his bed. My one servant, his nurse, deaf and silent,
never pried into my comings and goings. She believed,
like him, that they were accounted for by the chapel
meetings and mission-work; by necessary relaxation
and repose. I went in and out of this house at night by
the mews at the back. No one ever saw me enter. I
took care of that. To-day—to-day the doctor came.
He filled me with more hope than ever before. ‘Take
him to Italy,’ he said. ‘And ’twill be a cure!’ With
four thousand pounds in the bank——”</p>

<p>She stopped so suddenly that Pamela cast an arm
about her, fearing she might fall; but she clasped a
rigid strength. Mr. Sheridan raised his quizzing glass
to stare at the actress’s countenance; into her pale
cheeks a fierce colour had risen. She was amazingly
beautiful.</p>

<p>“And so, my dear Miss Falcon—my dear Mrs. Morgan,”
he cried curiously, “you took the favourable moment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
confessing your subterfuge, your heroic subterfuge, to
your pious husband! How did he bear it? A Welshman
and a chapel man! I trust it was not a shock.”</p>

<p>Her eyes turned upon him as if she were bereft of the
power of understanding.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sheridan means, ma’am,” cried the equerry
impatiently, “how did the good preacher bear the awful
revelation? Did you not yourself say that at four
o’clock—four, wasn’t it, Sherry?—the great Falcon
mystery ceased to exist.”</p>

<p>“You are right, sir,” said Fair Fatality. “When I
returned from rehearsal this afternoon I found—I saw—I
knew—there was no secret between us any more!
You want to know so much about me, all of you.” Her
voice rose suddenly and piercingly. “Your curiosity
shall be gratified to the end.”</p>

<p>She moved away from Pamela with a steady step,
flung open the folding doors, and pointed into the room
revealed with a single magnificent gesture.</p>

<p>Grasping the elbows of his chair, fuddled, inquisitive,
the Prince of Wales lifted himself to stare. Mr. Sheridan
took two strides and brought himself up with an
ejaculation. And “Damn me!” cried the equerry, in
accents of anger and fear. “This is a dashed low
trick!”</p>

<p>There was no need for anyone to cast a second glance
into that room. The lights and the flowers, the rigid
figure on the bed, covered with a white sheet, told their
own story. The genial party were looking upon death.</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor creature! You poor, unhappy dear!”
cried Pamela Pounce, bursting into hot tears, and catching
the Falcon to her heart.</p>

<p>The preacher’s wife abandoned herself to the embrace;
but only for the span of a moment, not for the relief of
tears, not for the comfort of another woman’s tenderness,
but because, just for that little while, every power
fell into suspense. When she disengaged herself they
were alone with the dead. Royalty and its boon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
companions had seized the opportunity to retire from a
scene so discomforting.</p>

<p>Felicity turned an abstracted gaze into the dining-room;
it was clear to Pamela that her visitors, Royalty
and all, were of less consequence in her mind than the
stray moth that fluttered round the candles.</p>

<p>“Will you look at him?” said the widow.</p>

<p>Pamela wished that she would cry or swoon. This
composure was terrible. Sobbing herself, she was drawn
to the bedside, and, as Felicity lifted the sheet, gazed
down upon the quiet, beautiful face. The play-actress
bent and kissed the young forehead set in such majestic
peace, and replaced the coverlet, re-arranging the white
roses after she had done so. Then once more she took
her companion by the arm, led her back into the dining-room,
and closed the folding doors.</p>

<p>“Now you must drink a glass of wine with me,” she
said, “before you go.”</p>

<p>“But I will stay with you.”</p>

<p>“No. No. The coach is waiting for you. The driver
will take you safe back. I prefer to be alone.”</p>

<p>She went to a cupboard and drew out a decanter and
a couple of glasses, and while Pamela sat and mopped
her eyes with a drenched handkerchief, and bit her lip to
keep down the rising sob, and chid herself for a poor,
vaporous wretch no use to anyone, the woman who had
lost her all poured out the wine with a steady hand; and
with a steady hand did something else besides.</p>

<p>She brought the glasses to the table, gave one to
Pamela, and stood watching her while she drank.</p>

<p>Then she sat down beside her, and, still holding her
own full glass between taper fingers, leant across and said:</p>

<p>“Kiss me, my dear, and thank you. When I went
back to him after the rehearsal to-day, so full of joy, the
woman said he was asleep, and I bent to kiss him, and,
oh, his lips were cold! His lips were cold! Yours are
warm. I wish I’d known you before. We should have
been friends. Nay, ’tis as well! I might have brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
misfortune to you as to the others. ’Tis better as it is,”
she repeated rather wildly.</p>

<p>And when sobbing that her own story was told and
that she knew too what a broken heart meant, Pamela
would have kissed her again, Felicity pushed her from
her, and drank quickly.</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, Pamela drew herself
physically and mentally together, twisted her handkerchief,
patted her curls, wiped her eyes a last time,
then, in the tone of one firmly determined on the right
course of action:</p>

<p>“The coach may go, I’ll not leave you!” she cried.</p>

<p>She broke off. Was it the scent of the flowers from
the death-chamber, or some curious flavour in the wine?
She was all at once aware of a singular, intense smell of
almonds in the air.</p>

<p>“Miss Falcon, Mrs. Morgan, my dear! Oh, you’re
faint, you’re ill, and no wonder!”</p>

<p>She clutched the sinking figure, but Fair Fatality had
acted her last tragedy.</p>

<p>Pamela Pounce never wore the Medusa ring. She
dared not; but she kept it all her life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In Which There is a Prodigious Scandal About<br>
Pink Flounces</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">None</span> ever knew the share which Pamela had taken in
Felicity Falcon’s last night on earth.</p>

<p>She had laid the slender figure as decently and respectfully
as she could, on a couch, kissed the cold cheek once
more, and walked out of the house.</p>

<p>Those who would find her in the morning must make
what they could of the story. Pamela had her own life
and those dependent on her to consider. She could not
afford to be mixed up with a scandal.</p>

<p>Whether the chapel people to whose ranks the young
preacher had belonged, were desirous of hushing up the
evidence which might bring discredit upon them, or
whether it were really believed that Mrs. Morgan had
died of a heart-stroke brought on by grief did not transpire.
They were buried together and given a very
pious funeral with much preaching and psalm-singing.</p>

<p>The event made a profound impression upon Pamela;
it revived the cruel emotions of her recent personal
experience.</p>

<p>She had seen what love meant as never before; she
understood its fearful supremacy, and how little anything
else mattered beside it in life. There were times
when she even envied Felicity Falcon; true, she had
loved to desperation and death, but she had loved and
been loved with a noble purity and faithfulness!</p>

<p>The memory of the young Welsh preacher’s dead face,
radiantly innocent, and of the triumph, set in agony, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
the actress’s countenance as she had last seen it, haunted
her continually. Death had stamped on their mortal
love the seal of eternity.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs had lain in wait, the whole warm
June sunset hour, till Miss Pounce should emerge from
the side-door of the shut-up shop; he followed the erect,
briskly walking figure with due discretion, and only
permitted himself to catch her up at the corner of Berkeley
Square. Then he accosted her.</p>

<p>“Don’t, I do beseech you,” he cried, quickly forestalling
the fierce repudiation in her eye, “don’t refuse
to listen! I have not come after you to insult you, I
haven’t, upon my honour! Pamela, I want to apologise.
I want to ask your pardon.”</p>

<p>His tone was so imploring and respectful, he looked
so eager, so gallant and handsome too, in the rosy amber
light, as he bent towards her, bare-headed, that her
weapon of pride seemed broken in her hand.</p>

<p>She tried to say with dignity: “There’s nothing more
that I ever wish to hear from you, Mr. Bellairs,” but
her voice faltered, and a sudden tear in each eye betrayed
her.</p>

<p>“See,” he went on eagerly. “The gate of the garden
there is open. Let us go in, and sit on that bench. Just
for a little while! Five minutes! One minute!”</p>

<p>Pamela, shaking her head, and exclaiming: “No, sir.
Nay, Mr. Bellairs, I cannot listen, ’tis impossible! ’Tis
wrong! ’Tis folly!” nevertheless allowed herself to be
drawn into the cool green tree-shadowed spot, and
actually sat down on the suggested seat.</p>

<p>He did not as much as offer her his hand; yet his
urgency drove her almost with a physical force.</p>

<p>“Oh, Pamela,” he cried, letting himself fall beside
her, and clasping his hands and wringing them, “can
you conceive what I felt when I heard that ’twas you—you!—oh,
my generous girl—who paid my debt? And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
to think how the first use I made of my liberty was to
offend you so grossly.”</p>

<p>Pamela swallowed a sob.</p>

<p>“’Tis over and done with now, Mr. Bellairs. Let me
forget.”</p>

<p>She tried to rise, but he caught a fold of her dress.</p>

<p>“One moment more, if you have a woman’s heart.
Nay, you see how anxious I am not to presume. I will
go on my knees if you like. Oh, Pamela, when I went
to pay back my Lord his ninety-seven pound ten, out of
that pocketful of money you know of, and he stared at
me, and: ‘Why, man,’ says he, ‘I never thought to see
you this morning! Her Ladyship was in one of her bad
ways, and sure, if it was I had been in the sponging
house, she’d not have out with a farthing! I’ve been
but waiting for a better moment,’ says he. ‘Then who,
in the name o’ God?’ cries I, cutting him short. Pamela,
I lost no time in making my <i>congé</i> to my Lord, and I
ran all the way to that fellow Jobbins—I promise you!
‘For I’ll get to the bottom of this,’ I cried. ‘And ’twas
a lady veiled,’ quoth he, and stuck to it, and the fool
that I am, must needs think my cousin Kitty was playing
a sort of game with me; ashamed not to pay for me, but,
the stingy thing! mortal afraid lest I should ask her
again! And I went back again to Hertford Street to
make a further exhibition of myself.”</p>

<p>Here Pamela could not keep from laughter.</p>

<p>“You laugh! ’Tis all I deserve. Indeed, ’twas
a monstrous absurd scene. But my Lady pretty soon
convinced me that the magnanimity I ascribed to her
was unknown to that bit of strass she calls her heart.
By the Lord, I think I was mad that morning altogether!
I hardly know how I got out of Hertford Street once
more, and all the way down to Jobbins, for the thought
had dawned! I’ve not so many friends, you see, Pamela!
‘A tall, fine figure of a lady,’ says he, ‘stepping as clean
as your own sorrel filly, Mr. Jocelyn. And I caught,’
says he, ‘a gleam of hair under the veil—now, if you’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
run your eye down the row in there,’ says he, jerking his
thumb towards his stables, ‘you’ll see, third from the
door, a bit of a gloss on a hack’s back that’s just the same
colour.’ And so I knew,” added Jocelyn, with a sudden
drop from his tone of mimicry, into accents of real
emotion.</p>

<p>Pamela set her teeth upon her trembling lip. She
made a desperate effort after her usual fine air of independence.</p>

<p>“’Twas when we were friends, I’ll have you remember,
Mr. Bellairs,” she said, with a toss of her
head.</p>

<p>“Ah, but Pamela, let us be friends now,” he spoke with
a boyish earnestness which made him infinitely more
attractive than in his most dashing mood of sparkishness.
“’Tis just for that I have sought you. I want your
forgiveness. I want your friendship. Let me see you
sometimes, as a friend, a most respectful friend, honoured
by your acquaintance. I am a wretched, worthless
fellow,” he went on, with a kind of bitter humility.
“I can’t even pay you back your loan, now, Pamela.
But grant me a chance. Let me show myself better than
you have known me. ’Pon honour, it would give me
something to hope for, just to think you’d let me see you
now and again, in a kindly way; that you had not cast
me altogether out of your life.”</p>

<p>It was the acknowledgment that he couldn’t pay her
back that softened Miss Pounce’s obduracy towards
him. She consented to forgive him, to consider him as
a friend, even to admit the possibility that if they met—oh,
quite accidentally!—on an off-day, she mightn’t
refuse to take a stroll with him in the Green Park.</p>

<p>It would seem as if nothing had changed; as if she
was the same too-trusting, foolish girl, and he the same
sly, audacious villain; yet, as she determinedly parted
from him and hurried out of the garden to her lodging,
she knew that there had come a profound alteration into
their relations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>Meanwhile the enmity excited in the bosoms of Miss
Smithson and Miss Popple against the successful
milliner was far from abating. Indeed, the mature
young lady who had hoped for Pamela Pounce’s present
position had an ever-gathering sense of grievance. What
if she had a heavy hand? Were there not solid dowagers
and others who preferred substance and money’s worth
to your fly-away gossamer nothings?</p>

<p>Between these two important members of Madame
Mirabel’s establishment, there had come to be a tacit
understanding—though they were far too genteel and
high-minded to indulge in anything like a conspiracy—that
it was their bounden duty, in dear Madame Mirabel’s
interests, to keep a sharp look-out on Miss Pounce, and
report any proceeding of hers calculated to injure them.</p>

<p>“As, of course, my dear, poor Anna-Maria,” Clara
Smithson would declare of her rich business relative,
“is that good-natured that times and times I’ve had to
step in, as it were, and save her from herself.”</p>

<p>Miss Popple was too tactful to request specification.</p>

<p>“La, you never say, dear!” she would exclaim, with
unflagging emphasis. “And what a good thing it is
that she’s got you, the poor kind creature! ’Tis what
we all feel.”</p>

<p>The while her private thoughts would run contemptuously:</p>

<p>“As if every one didn’t know, you long-toothed old
frump, that ’tis you Madame keeps on out of charity, and
has the books regular checked by a spry young gentleman
from the bank every Saturday night, private, or they’d
be in the muddle of the world before the month was
out!”</p>

<p>Miss Clara Smithson’s secret opinion of Miss Popple
was probably no more complimentary, but it is in the
nature of things that worthy individuals, working for a
common cause, should sink personal feelings; and,
therefore, when Miss Smithson made the appalling discovery
in connection with the pink-flounced muslin of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
Sunday afternoon, it was Miss Popple to whom she confided
it the first thing on Monday morning.</p>

<p>That Sunday afternoon being a remarkably fine day,
Miss Smithson had accepted the offer of the married
nephew in the Tobacco Trade, who was particularly
civil to her in view of her reported savings, to drive with
him in a hackney as far as Richmond Park, and partake
of a choice refection of ale and winkles by the river-side.
Now, as the hackney was rolling along the highway
towards Richmond, they passed a cottage on the outskirts
of the town, a quite superior cottage residence
with an embowered garden, honeysuckle and roses. In
this garden, upon a rustic chair, a young woman was
seated with a child upon her lap. She wore a conspicuous
dress of pink muslin. Her head, which was bent
over the child, was bare, unpowdered, and clothed with
a profusion of bright chestnut tresses. The child’s face,
Miss Smithson was able to observe, was very dark, almost
foreign-looking, and its little curly pate, coppery-red.</p>

<p>There was something familiar in the attitude of the
young person in the flaring frock, and Miss Smithson,
who was not a rapid thinker, puzzled over it most of the
afternoon. Towards the end of her last glass of ale,
neglecting the tempting offer of a final winkle which
the devoted nephew was extending to her on his tie-pin,
she clapped her hands and cried:</p>

<p>“I have it!”</p>

<p>Being asked to explain this strange diversion from the
business of the hour, she declined, and it was only into the
sympathetic bosom of Miss Popple that she now unfolded
her theories.</p>

<p>“Pamela Pounce it was, my dear, as I’m a living
sinner! There’s not another head like that on the town,
I’ll swear! And a little black child on her lap, as bold
as brass! Miss is so fashionable, too, as we all know.
Foh, the hussy! It really,” said the virtuous Miss
Smithson, “makes me shudder!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>And shudder she did, till Miss Popple thought she
heard her bones rattle.</p>

<p>“I always said,” said Polly Popple, “that there was
something mysterious about that young woman’s private
life. Dark, did you say, dear? We all know the complexion
of the young gentleman that used to come here
after Miss Pounce. And she’s been seen with him in the
Green Park again, most audacious of late. And what’s
to be done now,” she cried in a virtuous passion, “to get
her out of the house, and not have her contaminating
us respectable females? Let’s to Madame Mirabel this
moment!”</p>

<p>“Beware how you do such a thing!” exclaimed Miss
Smithson, horror-struck. “Tut, Polly! We’ve got to
get things a vast more circumspect before we take such
precipitous action. The first thing to find out is whether
Miss Pounce has a gown of that impudent colour.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask her this minute!” exclaimed Popple, springing
up from the little horsehair chair and making for the door.</p>

<p>“And if we do bring it home to her, Polly,” pursued
Miss Smithson, clutching her friend’s fat wrist, “far be
it from me to be hard on a fellow-creature, however
perverted and brazen. I’d rather put the matter before
Miss Pounce herself—ay, and before that good creature,
her aunt, my Lady Kilcroney’s woman, who’s had a
mort of trouble with her already—and get the abandoned
gal to send in her resignation, rather than upset my
cousin! Anna-Maria has a weak heart.”</p>

<p>Polly Popple pondered. Both prudent virgins exchanged
a look. It dawned upon these sensitive
consciences that Madame Mirabel might not be of their way
of thinking; might, in fine, be disposed to put modes
before morals, especially as custom was increasing every
day and the fame of Pounce millinery spreading far and
wide.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right,” said Polly thoughtfully.
“Well, I’ll be back as soon as I can, dear, and let you
know what I’ve drawn out of her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>The showroom was empty of custom, the hour being
still early, and Pamela, singing a little song under her
breath, was engaged, with the bright energy which
characterised her, in superintending the disposal of the
wares. She had fanciful schemes of colour differing
with each day, and subtly suited to the mood most
likely to be engendered by the weather. Thus, on a
cold, bleak autumn afternoon you might find a flamingo
flame of feather calling you through the glass; and on a
torrid July morning such as the present, the coolest and
most ethereal creams and greys; or a rustic straw with
a wreath of moon daisies that would set you dreaming of
the country. Even such a creation was Miss Pounce now
holding in her hand when, rather out of breath—for she
was of a stout habit and a congested type of comeliness—Polly
Popple came heavily up to her.</p>

<p>“And pray, Miss Pounce,” said the assistant, while,
at the abruptness of the address, unpreceded by the
usual “Good morning,” all the young ladies turned to
stare—“pray, Miss Pounce, was you by any chance
Richmond way yesterday?”</p>

<p>Polly was no diplomatist.</p>

<p>“And what’s that to you, Miss Popple?” responded
Pamela. “As a matter of fact, I was; but ’tain’t none
of your business, as I’m aware! Girls, what are you
doing?”</p>

<p>Pamela scented mischief, and resented the tone of the
question, which rang in unmistakable challenge. Nevertheless,
she remained good-humoured.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the other darkly, “’tis more my
business than you think of. Might I further inquire if
you was wearing a pink gown, miss?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Popple, I was. A pink gown, flounced to the
waist, muslin. A sweet thing it is, and suits me uncommon.
Perhaps you’d like to know if I wear a white
<i>bouffand</i> to it, and the style of hat?”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind the hat, Miss Pounce! Since you
are so obleeging as to permit me another question, might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
I ask if you was a-setting in a garden a-holding of a child
upon your lap?”</p>

<p>The colour flew like a flag to the head milliner’s cheek
and fire to her eye. Then she abruptly turned her back
upon the questioner, and the youngest assistant, who
happened to be taking a hat out of a drawer, was surprised
to see that she was struggling with a violent inclination
to laugh.</p>

<p>“Ho!”</p>

<p>The ejaculation leaped with a world of horror from
Polly’s lips.</p>

<p>Her superior wheeled back upon her.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Popple, I was sitting in a garden, and very
pleasant it was among the roses; and I had a child upon
my lap, the dearest, sweetest little creature that ever
breathed, a perfect cherub! A girl, if you want to know,
Miss Popple, and though dark, like to be a beauty.”</p>

<p>The young ladies tittered, though there were looks
interchanged, too. And Pamela’s tone, tripped up with
subterranean mirth, sounded to some of them rather
hysterical.</p>

<p>Polly, after a dumb show of wounded female delicacy,
expressively rendered, tottered from the room as if her
legs could scarce carry so much horrified rectitude; and
the incident apparently dropped. Indeed, Pamela regarded
it merely as another of Popple’s nasty bits of
spleen. A low-minded, common creature! As if her
girls would be taken in by such vile suggestions! As
if the life of Pamela Pounce, head milliner, was not as
fresh and fair as her own face!</p>

<p>An episode which Pamela could not but consider as
curious in the circumstances presently occurred and drove
the very existence of Popple from her mind.</p>

<p>A carriage drew up to the door, early as it was—ten
o’clock had not yet struck—and a customer entered, a
short, dark young woman of a marked type of Spanish
beauty, who walked with a bold cadence of the hips that
set her maize silk panniers swinging, and a carriage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
the head that you might call like that of a fawn, or of a
serpent, as your feelings towards her prompted.</p>

<p>Pamela advanced in her most engaging manner.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you, madam?” She broke off.
“Merciful heavens!” something within her cried. “I
should know that face.”</p>

<p>The newcomer fixed her with beautiful, insolent eyes.
There was a gleam of rubies in each delicate ear, and at
the dusky round throat a red fire that came and went
from a monstrous clasp of the same stones, half-hidden
by laces.</p>

<p>“If you will show me a hat, all black, with black
feathers,” began the lady. She had a slow voice, rich
like cream, and an odd guttural aspiration of the consonants.
“Something with the Spanish air.”</p>

<p>In her turn, she stopped short. The milliner had
fallen back a pace, and was looking at her with horror.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Pamela, very low but very distinctly,
“that you have entered this establishment by mistake.”</p>

<p>The foreign lady wheeled upon her. There was no
doubt about it, with all her beauty she was viperish.</p>

<p>“Fool, my name is the Countess Sanquhar!”</p>

<p>“And a very fit name for you, too!” responded
Pamela.</p>

<p>Upon which extraordinary observation she herself
opened the door and stood until the visitor passed
out.</p>

<p>You may be a beauty, and you may be the lawful wife
of an English peer, but it is difficult to keep your dignity
when you are turned out of a shop by a miserable working-woman
as if you were the last of the last. Only by
doing murder on her offender could the notorious Lady
Sanquhar, who had been once the respected wife of an
honest Spanish merchant, have redeemed the situation
from utter ignominy. But as she could not do murder
in actual fact, she only did it with her eyes, as, swaying
more than ever, she went forth.</p>

<p>Pamela shut the door; the four assistants stared at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
her with one accord. They had not known such an
exciting morning for a long time.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Miss Pounce,” said Polly Popple,
“you take a deal upon yourself, you do.”</p>

<p>Pamela sat down, rather white about the lips, breathing
quickly through dilated nostrils.</p>

<p>“If it had got known that I’d sold as much as a feather
to that creature,” she said, “Madame Mirabel might as
well put up her shutters, for there’s not a lady of quality
would have crossed the threshold of her showroom again.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In which my Lady Kilcroney Insists on the Duty<br>
of Morality.</span></p>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">If</span> you please, my Lady, might I speak to your Ladyship?”</p>

<p>My Lady Kilcroney looked up from the sorrows of
Miss Clarissa Harlowe, which she was particularly enjoying,
and gazed at her handmaiden.</p>

<p>Lydia Pounce and her mistress had gone through,
together, so many emotions, intrigues, quarrels, reconciliations,
triumphs, and despairs that it was scarcely
too much to say they had become indispensable to each
other. Therefore, too, both had grown to read each
other’s countenances with the utmost facility. Now,
Lydia was pale and pinched; her knobby little hands
were clasping each other fiercely across her neat waistband;
she was visibly trembling. Lady Kilcroney
knew these symptoms.</p>

<p>“What is to do, Lydia?”</p>

<p>“Ho, my Lady!”</p>

<p>The Abigail here clutched at her heart and turned up
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Dear me, Lydia,” said her Ladyship, tartly, “have
they ventured to laugh again in the pantry as you happened
to be passing, or has anyone broken into the safe
and stolen my diamonds?”</p>

<p>“Ho, your Ladyship, you may well ask. Heaven
knows I’m prepared from this out to be the laughing-stock
of this house. Everyone may point the finger of scorn
at me. The name of Pounce is for ever blasted! As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
for thieves, my Lady, there are worse thieves than will
ever be hanged walking about this moment, and treasures
stolen of value far above diamonds!”</p>

<p>“Dear me!”</p>

<p>“Her Ladyship wouldn’t be so easy with her ‘dear
me’s’ if she knew what’s happened. ’Tis gospel truth,
my Lady, and I’m telling no falsehood, that the thought
of having to inform your Ladyship is the bitterest part
of the sorrow that has come upon me this day!”</p>

<p>Kitty Kilcroney put down her book. Seeing that her
maid’s eyes were genuinely tear-stained, and that the
convulsive shiverings were not all assumed, she began
to feel concern.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” she said again, in quite another tone.
“I trust nothing has happened to your family—your
good brother, or any of the children?”</p>

<p>She broke off. Lydia, who was making the most
dreadful grimaces, here flung her little muslin apron over
her head and sobbed behind it.</p>

<p>“It’ll break my brother’s heart, him so respected on
his own property, as old in the name as gentry, yeomen
these hundreds of years, and only for bad times none of
them ever looking to service. And ho! my Lady, him
setting such store by that girl, and me so proud of her!”</p>

<p>“That girl! You don’t mean Pamela?”</p>

<p>Lydia dropped the apron.</p>

<p>“I do. The horrid, wicked creature. And ho, my
Lady, it all comes of encouraging idle young gentlemen
and paying their debts for them, and letting them off
going to India, and if the name of Pounce is blasted, the
name of Bellairs ain’t much better, and so I tell you,
fair and square, my Lady!”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” said my Lady Kilcroney, whisking
round so sharply on the sofa that Clarissa fell in one
direction, and my Lady’s cushions, fan, and pocket
handkerchief in the other. “Never tell me that that
silly young man is—has been—can be——”</p>

<p>“He was, he is, and as to can be, your Ladyship knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
yourself what young gentlemen are! Oh, to think of
its going on so long, though indeed, I might ha’ known!
Haven’t I seen them walking together on a Sunday afternoon,
times and again, and it’s all head toss and ‘How
dare you, aunt?’ if so much as a word of warning is
given!”</p>

<p>“Jocelyn Bellairs! But what has been discovered?
What proof have you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, la!” The fire of excitement was drying up the
elder Miss Pounce’s tears. “’Tis all over Mirabel’s already.
Proof, my Lady? Wasn’t the unfortunate girl seen
sitting in a garden last Sunday in a secret cottage, with a
dark baby on her lap? <i>A dark baby, my Lady!</i> And
think of Mr. Bellairs, as black as my shoe! And her, as
Miss Smithson—that’s the book-keeper, my Lady—who
has just left me, said to me, as bold as brass, all in the
sunshine. And she ain’t denied nothing, neither.”</p>

<p>“Who? Pamela?”</p>

<p>Kitty was falling from amazement to amazement. She
had seen a vast deal, one way and another, of Madame
Mirabel’s milliner, and if ever there was, in her opinion,
an honest, sensible, good-living young woman, it was
Pamela Pounce.</p>

<p>“She don’t deny it. Miss Popple up and taxed her
straight out, and she as good as admitted it. Not a bit
ashamed, either.”</p>

<p>“Foh!” my Lady fumed. “Surely you’re not
going to condemn your own flesh and blood on hearsay,
woman?”</p>

<p>“My Lady,” Lydia began to pant, as if she suddenly
remembered how hard she had been running. “I’m
back from Madame Mirabel’s this moment, and seen
Pamela, and oh, the audacity of her! Laughing in my
face, and tossing her head! ‘And ’tis true,’ cries she,
‘the little rogue is dark. And if I prefer ’em dark,’ says
she, ‘what then?’”</p>

<p>“‘Ho, Miss,’ says I, ‘your taste lies in the dark line,’
says I. ‘That’s no surprise to me you bold hussy!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
And then, my Lady, you’ll never believe it, she regular
insulted me.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ she says, ‘and if I do prefer a dark gentleman,
ain’t a body free to have their fancy? There’s you,’ she
says, ‘as likes them fat and cat-footed, with a wheeze and
a paunch,’ referring, my Lady, to the attentions Mr.
Blandfoot is paying me. And then I answers her back:</p>

<p>“‘I’m sure, you wicked girl, if Mr. Blandfoot and I ever
agree to settle, it’ll be as man and wife, respectable <i>and</i>
respected.’”</p>

<p>“‘Why, lud, aunt,’ she says, ‘you have a nasty mind.’
And more than that, my Lady, I couldn’t get out of her,
it being her busy time. And—oh, dear, to be sure!—was
there ever such a desperate bit of work? Her getting
on so well, fought over by the ladies, I may say!”</p>

<p>Lady Kilcroney allowed the lamentations to continue
without interruption for some time, her own thoughts
being concentrated on the painful problem. The more
she reflected upon it, the more, alas! she began to believe
in the story.</p>

<p>Old Bellairs’s nephew was a sad dog—a handsome,
plausible, dashing, insidious rascal—she knew that. And
that he had pursued Pamela with his attentions, she was
also aware. The girl’s attitude of defiance could hardly
go with innocence, and there was that strange story about
the debt. Now, Kitty liked Pamela, and she had a
certain sympathy, too, with a spirit that refused to
humiliate itself on a question of private conduct.</p>

<p>“I trust no one has ever been able to say of me that I
am otherwise than strictly virtuous,” she thought, “but
I can’t abide these prying prudes that think ’tis their
business to show up any poor child that’s made a slip
in her time.”</p>

<p>“And, ho, my Lady,” concluded Lydia, “they’ve kept
it from Madame Mirabel, on condition that my niece
resigns her situation.”</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Lydia, stop sniffing. If ’tis my poor
dear Bellairs’s nephew that wronged the girl, I’ll see that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
he makes reparation. He shall marry her. Leave it to
me. Leave it to me, I say! I’ll have the truth out of
them both, and then I’ll join their hands, I swear it,
before I’m two days older!”</p>

<p>Kitty was one of those whose plans are swiftly conceived
and whose impatient spirit will not brook an instant’s
delay in their execution. She sat down that very moment
to write to her graceless relative.</p>

<p>“He must not guess,” she thought, as her quill ran
with little squeaks and pauses—“he must not guess that
he is to be brought to book, or my young gentleman will
have a thousand good reasons for declining to present
himself.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Dear Nephew Jocelyn</i>,” wrote she, very silkily—“<i>Pray
come and visit me this next Thursday afternoon
at three of the clock. It is a long time since we have met,
and there is a little matter——</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Here Kitty stopped and nibbled at her pen. How
could she bait the trap so that the fox should fall into it?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>a little matter which I wish to discuss with you. I
think when you hear what it is, you will agree ’twas worth
wasting half an hour on your attached aunt-in-law</i>,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Kitty Kilcroney</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Kitty shook the pounce-box over the sheet, folded,
superscribed, and affixed with a pat a knowing little wafer
which bore the semblance of a rose with the touching
motto: “Sweet unto death.”</p>

<p>Then, popping her round chin on her clasped hands,
she gave herself to reflection, quite a minute’s reflection.</p>

<p>“If you want a thing well done, do it yourself. There
never was a sounder saw. I’ll not trust Lydia.”</p>

<p>My Lady took up her pen again.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>My good Pounce</i>”—thus ran the quill—“<i>Pray
present yourself here on Thursday at three o’clock, bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
the dark baby about which there’s such a to-do. I think I
have proved myself a friend to you; do you prove that you
recognise it by falling in with my desire.</i></p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">K. Kilcroney</span>.</p>

<p>“<i>P.S.—I was never more anxious to act well by you
than in this instance.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Having despatched these missives, my Lady kept her
counsel; and when the answers came—Mr. Bellairs’s
reply accepting rather effusively, with indeed, as his
benefactress felt, not without some malice, a lively sense
of favours to come; and Pamela’s in four respectful lines
couched in the best millinery phraseology—the plotter
locked them into her bureau, and forbade Lydia to mention
the subject to her again, if she valued her situation.</p>

<p>On the Thursday afternoon fixed for the meeting my
Lady Kilcroney thoroughly prepared to enjoy herself.
There was nothing she more relished than the ruling of a
difficult situation. She had no qualms as to the extent
of her genius; she had no inconvenient scruples as to her
wisdom.</p>

<p>The nephew of her late poor Bellairs had, it seemed,
wronged the young person in whom she took an interest.
He should be made to right that wrong, or her name was
not Kitty Kilcroney.</p>

<p>When the hour approached she clothed herself in
garments subtly adapted to her role, rich in texture, yet
grave in hue; a mulberry satin, to be precise, brocaded
with amber roses. Her toilet accomplished, she flung a
satisfied look into her mirror. ’Twas a bit heavy for a
summer’s day, but really, with the old deep-hued lace
at throat and elbows, mightily becoming.</p>

<p>Then she wheeled upon her maid.</p>

<p>“Now, Lydia,” ordered she, “you are not to show
your nose till I bid you. I’ll not have you poking it into
my arrangements. It’s a deal too sharp and fond of
prying, as it is. Ay, I do expect your niece and Mr.
Jocelyn Bellairs. And, no, I haven’t told you anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
about it. I’m to manage this business or I wash my
hands of it. If you goggle your eyes any more, Lydia,
they will drop out! Nay, I will not permit you a word
with Pamela. Nay, not so much as a look at her. You
will keep to your premises till I ring my bell.”</p>

<p>Lydia tossed her head a good deal, and was sure she was
very grateful to her Ladyship. And no one could accuse
her of wanting to interfere, Heaven knew! And, as for
looking at that creature’s bold face again till she was an
honest woman, it was enough for her the last time.
Heaven was her witness that she’d had a queasiness at
the pit of the stomach ever since!</p>

<p>Having issued her instructions, Kitty sailed downstairs,
turned the astonished Kilcroney out of his library, which
had, she considered, a more judicial appearance than the
gold-and-white drawing-room, ordered my Lord, in the
determined tone which he never resisted, to his club till
dinner-time; rang for a couple of footmen to remove my
Lord’s tankard, pipe and other witnesses of loose living
from the premises, and sat herself down in a large leather
arm-chair to await the sinners.</p>

<p>Three had not yet struck from the grandfather clock in
the corner when Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs was announced.
He entered with rather less of the conquering air than was
his wont. No doubt a very handsome youth, and vastly
improved in manners, thought Kitty, noting the exact
depth of his bow and the decorous air of homage with
which he kissed her extended hand. Attired, too, with
a quiet elegance, which, considering that the hand he
saluted was the one which had frequently paid his tailor,
was, my Lady considered, well chosen.</p>

<p>“Pray sit down, Nephew Jocelyn. I am glad to see you.”</p>

<p>When she had resumed her position in the seat of
justice, and he had deferentially placed himself in a high-backed
chair—a little too near her, she thought, for
proper respect, but some slight familiarity might be
pardoned to a relative—he looked at her interrogatively,
and there ensued a silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>It was not Kitty’s policy to put him at his ease by
small talk; rather, indeed, through a certain measured
severity, to awaken stirs of conscience. And as now his
fine brown orbs took the inward roll which she knew
betokened self-searching, she kept an immovable countenance,
looking down at her brocade lap and smoothing
a fold here and there with delicate, be-ringed fingers.
She had considerable knowledge of the world, this spoilt,
pretty child of fortune!</p>

<p>“I’ll wager,” thought she, “he’s counting up his debts,
and wondering which I’ve heard of, and never giving a
thought to his horrid immorality.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bellairs cleared his throat, glanced uneasily at his
hostess, began a sentence on the subject of the weather,
broke off in the middle and said, with a plunge:</p>

<p>“Here I am, then, Aunt Kilcroney, agreeable to your
command!”</p>

<p>“And, indeed, ’tis no less than your duty, I should
think. ’Tis a vast of time, sir, since you have done me
the honour to call upon me. Yet I think each quarter
day brings you the wherewithal to remember me by,
to say the least of it.”</p>

<p>He looked at her with an expression in which relief and
disappointment struggled. Was it only to keep him to
heel, like a well-trained dog, that she had sent for him?
Was there nothing but huffiness at his lack of assiduity to
account for her air of disapproval, or had she heard of that
little bill to which my Lord Kilcroney had so good-naturedly
set his name? Or of that ruffling night at the
Cocoa Tree when he had lost four hundred pounds to my
Lord Sanquhar, and thereafter raised the money to settle
it with Mr. Aaron, on my lady’s own banker’s order to
himself? A transaction which might have been ruin
indeed if the most generous girl in all the world had not
got him out of the sponging house in time. Here his
cogitations came to an abrupt end, and the very person
in his thoughts stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>He got up, all amazement, as my lady too, majestically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
rose. What in the name of Heaven brought Pamela
Pounce hither, and why, by all that was crazy, was she
carrying a little dark child in her arms?</p>

<p>The young man flushed, bit his lip, and trembled with a
sudden fury. By Heaven, if Pamela had gone behind his
back to tattle to my Lady, he would—yes, dash it, he would
pay her back and never speak to the chit again!</p>

<p>“Is this the child?” said Kitty, with a bell-like tone
of melancholy.</p>

<p>Pamela curtsied with great deliberation for all reply,
and, at a wave of Kitty’s hand, gracefully sat down,
settling her pretty burthen in her lap.</p>

<p>It was a little girl, beautiful in a dark way, with devouring
brown eyes. She was exquisitely dressed in a lawn
frock, with insertion and mignonette trimming. The
Princess Amelia could not have been finer clad, thought
Kitty, and as Pamela took off the straw hat with the
ostrich feathers and revealed an ordered tangle of copper
curls, which would one day be night-black, threaded
through with a faint blue ribbon, my lady could hardly
restrain a cry of admiration.</p>

<p>Kitty stood and looked at Mr. Bellairs. He was in the
throes of undeniable agitation. She looked at Pamela,
serene and, as she gazed down at the child, Kitty thought,
lovely, with a maternal softening of her bright, handsome
face.</p>

<p>“Ah, Jocelyn Bellairs!” cried Lady Kilcroney,
dramatically, “you may well turn away. You may well
feel that sight were more than you can endure. But raise
your eyes, sir. Behold, behold, and let your heart speak.
Can you call yourself a man and refuse that trusting
creature her rights, refuse that exquisite cherub a father’s
name?”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” cried Jocelyn. He cast the hat he had
been clasping under his arm into the middle of the room,
the better to clutch his temples. “Am I stark, staring
mad? What monstrous stroke is this, what plot, what
inconceivable mistake?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>There was such a ring of truth in his accents that my
Lady shot a doubting glance at Pamela, but conviction
returned upon her as she saw this young woman bending
over the child so as to hide her face, and shaken with
hysterical emotion.</p>

<p>Kitty drew a long breath, and started again.</p>

<p>“Do not think, nephew, that by adding deceit to your
vileness, you can make a better situation for yourself.
Far from it. I have not sent for you here to-day to
rebuke or even to reproach. My sole desire is to help you
both. Heaven forbid that I should be hard on any
woman who has been betrayed by her own heart!</p>

<p>“Pamela, if you had confided in me ere this—nay,
never mind now! Suffice it that I know all. As for you,
sir, I am well aware that gentlemen think all too lightly
of a woman’s virtue; that if their fancy leads them to
court in a lower class than their own, the most hitherto
virtuous and confiding female becomes, to use their own
horrid words, fair game.</p>

<p>“But I’ll not have Pamela Pounce treated so! She’s
far too good for you, sir, and so I tell you straight. And
the proposal which I am about to make to you is for her
sake, and not for yours. You shall marry this good
young woman—good but for you, you scamp!—and I
shall make it my business to place you in an advantageous
position out of England. I’ll pay your debts again, sir,
and set you up. I have not thought where yet, but it
shall not be India, for the little angel’s sake——”</p>

<p>Here she stopped suddenly. Her eye strayed to the
child, and she saw, to her utter amazement, that the
young milliner was laughing, not weeping.</p>

<p>“Pamela Pounce!” she cried, in a scandalized voice.</p>

<p>Pamela got up and set the child on the floor.</p>

<p>“Will your Ladyship observe the little one? She is
small for her age, I know, nevertheless it is plain to see
she is over two years. How old are you, Carmelita?
Tell the lady.”</p>

<p>The child, who had maintained a solemn observant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
silence during the whole proceeding, her great eyes roaming
from one person to another, while she contentedly sat on
Pamela’s lap, now looked up into her friend’s face with a
roguish smile.</p>

<p>“Tell the pretty lady.”</p>

<p>“Tell you,” said the child.</p>

<p>“Well, then, tell Pamela.”</p>

<p>But with the perversity of its sex and years, the child
was here seized with overwhelming giggles and buried its
head in Pamela’s skirt.</p>

<p>Kitty was staring with her mouth and eyes open,
while a dawning sense of something utterly ludicrous and
amazing showed itself on her face.</p>

<p>“If her Ladyship will kindly tax her memory,” Pamela
spoke in ineradicable bonnet-shop phraseology—“to
the extent of recollecting that I met Mr. Bellairs for the
first time on the doorstep of this house but eighteen
months ago, she will realise that——”</p>

<p>“Enough! Enough!” cried Kitty.</p>

<p>She waved her hand, fell back into her arm-chair,
pressing her filmy handkerchief to her lips, trying to
check her peals of laughter. Perhaps she was not quite
so overwhelmed with merriment as she pretended. Perhaps
she felt that the only way of mitigating the supreme
ridicule of her situation was by being the first to laugh
at it.</p>

<p>As her patroness laughed, Pamela waxed serious,
while Jocelyn Bellairs stood scarlet and indignant, the
picture of offence and injured rectitude.</p>

<p>“I little thought, my Lady, when those cats at Mirabel’s
got hold of my cat of an aunt—begging your Ladyship’s
pardon—and started this scandal against me, and all
along of seeing my pink flounces at tea with old Madame
Guturez, this darling’s grandmother, I little thought
your Ladyship would be ready to believe such an outrageous
bit of spiteful nonsense.</p>

<p>“When they upped and attacked me, says I to them,
‘Mind your own business!’ Heaven be good to me,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
said Pamela. “I wasn’t going to stoop to defend myself
to them, and if I hadn’t been the best-natured girl
in the world, I’d have gone straight to Madam Mirabel,
and told her then and there of their plot!</p>

<p>“And as for Aunt Lydia—well, her ladyship knows
herself. Those old maids have the minds of I don’t
know what. It’s enough to be young and good-looking
for them to think the worst of you. And her a-drawing
in Mr. Bellairs so shameful. I don’t mind confessing to
you, my Lady, that the more that poor old thing shook
and shivered, and went on at me, the more I thought it
would be a fine joke to let her give herself away. But
when it comes to your Ladyship——”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Kitty, not quite liking the tirade,
with pansy eyes rather angry over tightly smiling lips.
“You had but to write me three words of explanation,
Pamela——”</p>

<p>“Begging your Ladyship’s pardon, if I’d explained
ever so, your Ladyship wouldn’t have believed. No lady
would ever believe a poor girl accused like me, if she
didn’t bring up proof. And allow me to point out, your
Ladyship,” went on the milliner, with a flourish, as if she
were indicating some remarkable feather or trimming,
“that your Ladyship having merely wrote me to come
round with the child, it wouldn’t have been becoming in
me to be attributing meanings to your Ladyship’s commands.”</p>

<p>The fire went out of Kitty’s eyes, for she was a just
woman; she laughed again, and this time with a genuine
ring.</p>

<p>“Why, was there ever such a girl! And I so moved
over your story, and so yearning over the child, and so
stirred up, ready to threaten and appeal. And so pleased
with myself to be standing such a friend to you, and
bringing Master Jocelyn to book so clever!”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Pamela, “she’s not mine at all.” Here
she swung the little creature up into her arms, and hugged
her. “And I’m sure I wish she was. There, I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
know what I wouldn’t have gone through to have such a
little darling as this all my own! No, she’s not mine,
your Ladyship. Poor innocent. Ah, ’tis cruel! It’s
worse than no mother at all she has, her that’s the child
of the wretch that calls herself Lady Sanquhar.”</p>

<p>Both Kitty and her nephew-by-law cried out at this;
Master Jocelyn was shaken from his injured mood by
sudden memories.</p>

<p>“What, that odious, bold-faced, dressed-up strumpet!”
exclaimed Kitty, “driving about in the park in his
Lordship’s curricle, and brazening it at the Opera, till a
woman of virtue scarce knows which way to look!”
and:</p>

<p>“The Spanish woman that ran away with Lord Sanquhar!”
shouted Mr. Bellairs, “whose husband was
shot before my very eyes as he was trying to stop her?
Aye, aye, I remember there was a little child.”</p>

<p>“And only three days ago,” said Pamela, “I turned
the woman out of the shop. ’Tis transported she’d be,
if justice were done.”</p>

<p>At this my Lady Kilcroney stepped across the room
and embraced Miss Pamela Pounce. Then she kissed
the child, too, with lingering, repeated caress, that
round velvet cheek stirring irresistible motherly passions.</p>

<p>“And it shall have a cake, it shall, and nice chockey
to drink, it shall, the pretty rogue! Ring the bell,
Jocelyn.”</p>

<p>Having obeyed, Mr. Bellairs advanced, nostrils dilated,
swaggering a little as he came, with a defiant smartness
which did not sit ill on him.</p>

<p>“I presume, Aunt Kilcroney, that as there is nothing
else upon which you can desire to confer with me, you
would wish me to withdraw. Nevertheless, there is one
word I should like to say in your hearing to Miss Pamela
Pounce. Will you spare me a hand, Pamela. Thank
you. I kiss this honest hand, this honest, kindly, helpful
hand, and I say that if you will condescend to bestow it
on me, I will——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>But Pamela drew away her fingers, and curtsying,
child and all, said with great dignity:</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Bellairs, I have no intention of
changing my state.”</p>

<p>Kitty looked doubtfully from one to the other. Had
he been in earnest? She saw that Pamela did not think
so, for the girl had coloured to the roots of her hair, and
tossed her head. She would have no gentleman’s pity
or condescension.</p>

<p>The countenance of the young man was inscrutable,
as he bowed very low, turned on his heel, and left the
room.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was past nine that evening before Madame Mirabel’s
head milliner had sufficiently made up her afternoon’s
holiday to be able to leave the workroom. There was a
purple twilight over the whole busy town, and the lamplighter
was going round with his ladder, leaving a jonquil
flame behind him at long intervals. Here and there a
torch flared in a link. The streets were full of the sound
of feet, the quick feet of those hurrying home, the slow
feet of the strollers. Pamela was tired; the day had
been a long and agitating one. She paused a moment on
the pavement, outside the shop, to inhale the warm air,
and to enjoy the sense of leisure, at last. Her mind
worked mechanically.</p>

<p>“A twist of purple net on dark blue satin, with a tuft
of orange feathers. ’Twould be a new combination and
vastly genteel. (’Twould suit my Lady Kilcroney too,
with her pansy eyes.)”</p>

<p>Some one came up behind her with a quick tread that
suddenly faltered. Then a voice called her:</p>

<p>“Pamela!”</p>

<p>“La, Mr. Bellairs, what a start you give me!”</p>

<p>“May I go a little way with you, Pamela dear?”</p>

<p>“There now! If that isn’t a gentleman all over,
and me having only just re-established my character!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
A-waiting for me again outside Madame Mirabel’s, with
goodness gracious knows how many cats’ eyes a-spying on
me from behind the shutters!”</p>

<p>Something about the girl’s gay courage, her sane,
bright outlook on life, touched him at a spot already
exceedingly vulnerable. Anyone else, he thought, would
be having the vapours over this afternoon’s work; reproaching,
weeping, lost in self-pity and recrimination.
He reflected, too, how it might have been, had she
listened to him one winter’s evening, and one summer’s
day. A girl in a thousand! His mind had been
already made up, but he ratified the inner decision with
an ardent leap of the heart.</p>

<p>They went on side by side, till they reached the Park,
and then she remembered again, how, a few yards away,
nearly two years ago, she had snatched a pistol from
him. He stopped her, and spoke.</p>

<p>“Pamela, I asked you to give me your hand to-day.
I ask you again to be my wife. Oh, when I saw you
stand with the little dark child in your arms, which they
thought was ours, I vowed you were the one woman in
the world for me! Oh, I have been a base wretch! I
owe you money, I owe you my honour. I owe you my
life. I owe you something more worth than all these;
the only real, the only pure love I have ever known.
Pamela! You’ll make a man of me yet, if you’ll have
me.”</p>

<p>She had once been shaken, flattered by his attentions;
had looked up at him as a being, splendid, dashing,
gallant, altogether out of her sphere. When he had
courted her, it was as if a god had stooped. But this
evening he was something quite different to her: a weak,
wild youth whom her love might steady; a spendthrift,
a gambler, an amiable prodigal for whom she might
prepare the fatted calf, whom her ring might bind to
home; one, in fine, who had need of her. It was the
mother in her who smiled on him now with wet eyes.</p>

<p>Under a high moon, and a sky full of stars they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
presently discussed plans that seemed to Pamela to
combine the bliss of Eden with the practicality of a
work-a-day world.</p>

<p>“I’ll not give up my business, sir! I’ll never pretend
to be other than I am. No false lady airs for me!”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t be Pamela if there were. You shall
do exactly what you like! But I’m going to work too.
Indeed, my dearest girl, I will! And we’ll have that
cottage somewhere in the green, not too far but what
you can get the coach of a morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Pamela, clasping her hands and laughing.
“I’ll have roses in the garden, and sit out of a Sunday
in a pink muslin dress with flounces!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In which my Lady Kilcroney makes an Indelicate<br>
Fuss</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord Kilcroney</span> had none of your nasty prudish
minds that think harm of a kiss. To salute a rosy cheek,
or clasp a trim waist came as natural to him as to toss
off a tankard of brown ale, or light his long clay, or sit
in the sunshine. And indeed, my Lady, knowing him,
had as a rule an indulgence for such peccadilloes; the
merest shrug of the shoulders or a “Fie for shame, my
Lord!” in a voice scarce more indignant than that in
which she chid the littler Denis for putting his fingers
in the sugar bowl. But the mischief was in it, this
summer at Weymouth, Kitty being in attendance on
her Royals, that such a change should come over the
whole spirit of the whilom sensible spouse.</p>

<p>Such a hullaballoo over a kiss! If ever there was
anything likely to drive a really faithful husband to
desperate courses, it was this unexpected, undeserved,
severity.</p>

<p>Unfortunately he had been unlucky in his choice of
partner for the peccadillo. Molly Lafone’s smooth
cheek, fine grained as a geranium leaf, and as delicately
rouged as a miniature, Molly Lafone’s cheek, ethereally
tinted, had the quality of pitch in the eyes of the other
ladies, and the touch of it defiled.</p>

<p>My Lord, puffing at his clay in the County Club at
Weymouth, with an air half humorous, half defiant, and
thinking back on that same cheek with a certain complacence,
might perhaps have altered his opinion on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
whole matter had he been aware how neatly Mrs. Lafone
had timed the episode for the passage of the Queen’s
equipage.</p>

<p>They had met, quite accidentally, on the parade.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Lord Kilcroney,” quoth she. “Is it indeed
you?”</p>

<p>Her victim as good-humoured and devil-may-care as you
please, brought himself up with a wheel and a flourish.</p>

<p>Molly was clasping her hands. It was her trick to go
like a snowdrop in the dawn, when the rest of womanhood
flared carnation on the cheek. Her small faintly tinted
face was absolutely irradiated.</p>

<p>“Is it indeed you, Denis Kilcroney? I declare ’tis
like meeting the sun in a fog to see you! Oh, your kind
look, my Lord, and your good smile! This place——”
She broke off.</p>

<p>“How now!” said he, gallantly saluting a pearl-like
inch of wrist between rumpled glove and race ruffle.
“What’s wrong with the place, Mrs. Lafone? Troth,
and I thought it was the St. James’s over again, for every
ten steps don’t I come across a friend! And this is the
best meeting of all,” he added, with another bow, another
kiss, and a still broader smile, for—deuce take him!—the
little thing had been monstrous glad to see him, there
was no mistake about that, and he was nothing if not
responsive. “And as for the sun,” he went on, straightening
himself, and gazing down at her rather fatuously.
“Isn’t the great orb of Royalty shining on Weymouth
this minute?”</p>

<p>Now Molly Lafone knew how to play such an one as
Denis Kilcroney, as a skilful angler plays a fish. She
had hooked him with that glance of innocent joy: now
she drove the crochets in more firmly by an air of flutter
which would have melted any masculine temperament.</p>

<p>(“Oh, I have betrayed myself,” her tremor, her shy
butterfly glance, her sigh, her shaken laughter proclaimed.)</p>

<p>“Oh, the Royal orb,” she murmured. “Oh, my
Lord!” Then, “Aye, true, indeed. Oh, as you say!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
The orb and sceptre. George——” here a gleam of mischief
came like April sunshine to drive the shadows from
her pretty, abashed countenance. Her faltering voice
took a saucy note. “George and his Dragon,” she
whispered, tittered, put her finger to her lip. “Oh, the
mortal dullness of it! I’m a Parson’s daughter, as your
Lordship knows, and brought up prodigious proper, but
I vow and declare that if anything could make me wish—want
to shake off my sense of piety and virtue—what
am I saying? Good heavens, my Lord Kilcroney!
You are but just arrived; but if Windsor is pompous and
dull, Weymouth is—Oh!” she yawned.</p>

<p>Kilcroney was eyeing her, his sides shaking with mirth,
but at the words pompous the laughter left his lips, he
scratched his chin.</p>

<p>“Well, now that you mention it, my dear,” he murmured,
“it struck me there was a certain tedium in the
air.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tedium!” cried Molly, and went off on another
yawn.</p>

<p>As she yawned, he reflected. Pompous, she had said.
There had distinctly been a shade of pomposity about his
Kitty, as, just landed from the coach, he had hurried to
embrace her, scarce eighteen hours ago.</p>

<p>“Heavens, Denis, not in full view of the window.
The Princesses are fond of an evening walk. And good
gracious, my Lord, what a coat to travel in, and the
King’s gentlemen always point-device! And pray, dear
Denis, let me send for the hairdresser, for if Her Majesty
was to see you, such a show, down the parade, and she
so set against the Irish, I scarcely know how I could bear
myself in her Presence.”</p>

<p>This was the welcome Denis had had the day before;
and it had somewhat clouded his morning thought. It
had taken all the comfort of his recent passage through
the hands of a first-class barber, and of as good a tankard
of burnt Sherry as ever he had tasted at the County Club,
to restore him to the good humour in which Mistress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
Lafone had found him. He now thought back upon his
grievance, and as is often the case, with an increased
sense of injury.</p>

<p>“’Pon me soul, you’re in the right of it! And what
in the world my Lady and the rest of them want to be
hanging on the Court for, this way, passes me. Glory
be to God, doesn’t weariness ooze out of them all? It’s
sodden they are with it.”</p>

<p>“Weariness,” echoed she again. She glanced up at
the black-faced clock with the white figures on the church
tower across the way. The sea was on the other side of
them; the foam-capped waves tossing and furling and
pursuing each other in playful frolic like myriads of lambs
on a deep blue field. There was a gay sky to match, and a
gay wind, full of an intoxicating tang, and it blew Mistress
Lafone’s shot green taffety into balloons, and silvery
liquifactions, and fluttered her light curls, and set the
long amber streamers of her rustic hat flying like pennons.
She glanced back from the clock to my Lord’s
face, and her eyes danced and flickered as if the sea were
in them, and suddenly filled with huge tears.</p>

<p>“’Tis not the weariness, I mind,” she exclaimed with
a sob. “’Tis the cruelty!”</p>

<p>“Why, you poor little bird,” quoth he, tenderly
compassionate. “Could anyone be cruel to you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed, they are, my Lord, and I can’t think
how I have offended them! Oh, the slights, the unkindnesses!
And my Lady Kilcroney, your own dear lovely
lady, my Lord, what hath she against me.... Oh, I do
assure you,” cried Mrs. Lafone, raising her voice piteously,
as the measured trot of royal horses beat upon her ear.
“I’ve cried myself to sleep, night after night. And
when I saw your face, ‘here’s one,’ I said to myself,
‘who will be a little kind to me!’”</p>

<p>The wind—it certainly was a naughty wind, as if it, too,
were a rebel against the decorum imposed by the presence
of Royalty—came rushing up from the wide ocean and
caught Mistress Lafone in a positive whirl, seizing her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
with a great beat of invisible pennons as if about to fly
away with her.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” she cried. Her light figure swayed and
seemed to lift. She flung out her arms. What could my
Lord do but catch her? And holding her, what could he
do, but kiss her? For there were tears on her delicate
face which melted him, and sparkles behind them which
dared him; and what’s a kiss when all is said and done?</p>

<p>The Royal carriage wheeled by them, and Kitty, sitting
bolt upright opposite the Queen, had a good view of her
erring spouse and his infamous companion for the whole
length of the parade. It can scarcely be credited: the
culprits, as they gazed back at her, were laughing.</p>

<p>The matrimonial course of the Kilcroneys had been
fond, but as anyone who knew my Lady might guess, it
had been variegated. She had a quick temper, an impatient
spirit, and a detestation of monotony; withal the
soundest heart in the world. So that never did couple
so often fall out, or so fervently make it up, as they.
My Lord, who was of an easy-going temperament, who
loved and admired his Kitty in all her moods, rather
enjoyed these connubial storms.</p>

<p>“Begad,” he would say, “there never was anything to
equal a dash of red pepper for making a man enjoy the
taste of the wine afterwards.”</p>

<p>But now my Lady’s wrath took an unpleasant form;
one which, in its turn, aroused his resentment. It drove
him even to a certain bitterness, as he sat in the bow-window
of the County Club, pulling at his long clay. It
drove the complacent memory of Molly Lafone’s smooth,
pert cheek from his mind as with a sting.</p>

<p>“’Pon me word,” he said, swinging his leg. “A man
would think it was the leper I’d made of myself! Split
me, Verney, if me Lady doesn’t whisk away her skirts as
she crosses me path! And never a word out of her since
she first had at me—Bejabers! I’m not like to forget
that in a hurry! But it’s pinched lips and dropped eyes
and turn away with her till I’m crazy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>Squire Day and my Lord Verney gazed with compassion
on the sinner, the compassion that is the worst
kind of condemnation. Then Squire Day said, a little
drily:</p>

<p>“’Tis a pity that the occasion should have been quite
so public.”</p>

<p>And my Lord Verney, drawing in his turn the clay
from his lips, burst out:</p>

<p>“Susan says—My Lady Verney hath it that ’twas
Mistress Lafone’s very plan, to show you up before their
gracious Majesties and shame Kitty.”</p>

<p>Kilcroney stared a moment with widening eyes and
dropping jaw at the speaker. Then the crimson rose in
his handsome dissipated face.</p>

<p>“Ah! God help you!” he exclaimed, “if that isn’t
the ladies all over. ’Tis the down of the world they have
on that poor little creature. And what in the name o’
God should she want to be playing such a thrick for?
And sure, oughtn’t I to know, ’twas the innocentest——”
he broke off, for Squire Day’s laugh was loud.</p>

<p>“Innocent?” he repeated. “My dear Kil, ’tis you
who are as innocent as Adam! But I’m with you on one
point. The ladies have treated that little Lafone monstrous
cruel. I doubt if they have as much as let her
nibble a macaroon with them since they came down here.
And your Kitty has given the lead.”</p>

<p>“My Kitty!” exclaimed her spouse in a generous heat.
“Why, man, she’s picked that same Molly out of a hundred
scrapes. Sure, Lafone’s no more sense than a child.
Why, she owes my Lady——”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Squire Day, quietly, “she’s one who pays
back with interest.”</p>

<p>Kilcroney stared again.</p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged if I know what you’re driving at, men,”
he began, but suddenly fell silent with fixed eyes.</p>

<p>His arm-chair was opposite the door, which had now
been quietly opened; a fine portly gentleman walked in
as if the place belonged to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“Tare and ’ounds, lads,” cried the Irishman, under his
breath. “Here’s His Royal Highness!” and sprang to
his feet.</p>

<p>The next instant the club-room rang with shouts of
mirth.</p>

<p>“By the Holy Father! Stafford! Ned, me boy, I
took you for the Prince of Wales. ’Pon me living soul,
I did. Oh, Ned, Ned! ’tis the fill of your waistcoat you
are, and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“His Highness ought to be flattered,” said Mr. Stafford,
who was not.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Pamela Pounce was deposited at The White Hart,
Weymouth, by the midday coach, having slept at Dorchester.</p>

<p>She looked as crisp and modish as one of her own hats,
as she tripped along the parade towards my Lady Kilcroney’s
lodgings, followed by a porter who moved in a
perfect grove of bandboxes.</p>

<p>Miss Pounce had travelled to Weymouth with a selection
of hats and heads for the tempting of her fashionable
clientele. Born business woman as she was, she carried
her unerring instinct into every detail, such as that very
halt at Dorchester, which enabled her to impress at once
by her appetising freshness and her air of not having lost
a minute in providing an esteemed customer with the
very latest; “piping hot,” as she herself expressed it.</p>

<p>She had no hesitation in the choice of her first patroness.
My Lady Kilcroney gave the lead and Madame Mirabel’s
partner only spoke the truth when she averred that she
had rather have my Lady’s custom than that of Queen
Charlotte and all the Princesses.</p>

<p>Softly signalling to the burthened porter to wait in the
hall, Miss Pounce nipped two special bandboxes from his
grasp and herself mounted the stairs behind Kitty’s
black boy. Her Ladyship was in her bedroom. That
suited Pamela very well; in fact she had timed herself
to find Kitty in her <i>négligé</i>, perfumed from her toilet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
restored by her morning chocolate, just planning the
pleasures of the day. Miss Pounce smiled, as bending
her ear she caught the sound of feminine voices and
laughter within. A discreet play of nails upon the
panels remaining unanswered, she gave one authoritative
tap and entered.</p>

<p>Kitty, in a cloud of lace, with lavender ribbons, occupied
the centre of the apartment, throned in a high winged
arm-chair. Her elbows were on the table before her,
on which were strewn divers coloured prints and an
immense heap of light-hued patterns of silk and satin.
On either side of her sat her two special cronies: Lady
Anne Day and Lady Flora Dare-Stamer. All three heads
were bent together; no conspirators planning the downfall
of the Crown, could have seemed more wrapped in
mysterious colloquy. Pamela had to “hem” before
her presence was noticed. Then the faces were lifted
with a start, and Miss Pounce had no reason to complain
of the effect of her unexpected appearance.</p>

<p>Kitty clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“What good wind has driven you hither, child, to-day
of all days?”</p>

<p>“And I who was thinking,” cried Nan Day, “that
I hadn’t a head to my curls, fit to appear at Kitty’s
party, for my country slut has packed your rose tulle
turban, and the Paris toque, Miss Pounce, I do assure
you, as if she was stuffing a goose!”</p>

<p>“As for me,” said Lady Flora, “I haven’t paid Madame
Mirabel’s account this goodness knows how long. But
there—I think she knows I’m no bad customer after
all”—with her fat laugh. “And I’m sure she’ll let me
have a mode to set off my poor countenance, or I shall
be lost indeed, amid so much youth and beauty!”</p>

<p>Miss Pounce put down her bandboxes, to give them
admirably differentiated curtsies, and drew in her breath
with that sucking sound which meant the excess of
enjoyment.</p>

<p>My Lady Kilcroney was about to give an entertainment;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
an entertainment before which every other effort
of hers should pale. It was to be honoured with the
presence of the King and Queen and the Princesses;
that went without saying. But it was to be more distinguished
even than this. His Royal Highness, the
Prince of Wales, was expected for three days at Weymouth,
on a kind of reconciliation visit to Their Majesties—there
had been one of those too frequent ruptures between
them—and my Lady’s party was the only one which he
had signified his pleasure to attend. Never in all her
triumphant days had Kitty reached such a triumph.
It was no wonder that her eyes sparkled, and her hands
trembled, as she turned over patterns, and discussed
minuets.</p>

<p>Five violins from the Opera were coming, and the
famous lady harpist. Only the select of the select were
to be admitted to the sacred circle. The supper was to
beat every feast that Kitty’s chef, with the assistance of
several club friends, had ever before accomplished, and
Kitty’s costume (carmine brocade powdered with silver
rosebuds), was to outshine anything that that leader of
fashion had previously donned.</p>

<p>“I declare I was about to post an express to Madame
Mirabel to get you down, my dear,” said Kitty when the
first clatter of conversation had something died away.</p>

<p>Pamela pinched her lips.</p>

<p>“Well, if it isn’t Providence! I’ve got in that bandbox
a head!—a head, I say, my Lady, roses dew-dropped
with Strass, and just a twist of silver net illusion—if it
ain’t Providence!”</p>

<p>Perhaps Miss Lydia Pounce had assisted Providence
in this matter. That admirable abigail had her wits all
about her.</p>

<p>The three charming ladies held their breath while the
nimble young milliner went down on one knee and began
to unfasten the cordings of the larger bandbox. Scarcely
had her fingers reached the palpitating stage of tissue
paper, when the door was flung violently open, and Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
Kilcroney marched into the room. He came in with
a great swing of coat-tails and stamp of high boots, and
it was plain to see, by other tokens—his flaming eye, his
dilated nostril, his clenched jaw—that he was in a towering
rage.</p>

<p>The ladies fell apart, with the movement of scared
birds under the dash of the hawk. Even Kitty cowered
in her chair, though only for a second. Before the
gathering wrath exploded, she had reared her pretty
head in defiance, and was ready to meet him with a
temper-flash as stormy as his own.</p>

<p>He flung on the table an open letter—a fragrant, pink
sheet it was, with coquettish wafer still attached—and
pinning it with his finger, asked in a voice, hoarse and
trembling from his efforts to control it: “Is this a forgery,
my Lady, or is it a bad joke?”</p>

<p>Kitty glanced down at the scrap of paper, marked with
her own delicate caligraphy, in the latest thing in violet
inks; then, her hotly-resentful gaze contradicting the
ice-cold mockery of her accents: “I marvel, my Lord,
that you can find a joke in what is to me so monstrous
sad.”</p>

<p>“I say it’s a bad joke, a blanked, ill-bred, devilish bit
of cattiness!”</p>

<p>“Oh, pray, pray!” tittered my Lady on the edge of
hysterical fury. “Remember you are not in the bosom
of your family, Denis. Here are witnesses——”</p>

<p>“Witnesses, is it? I’ve nothing to hide, I’d have it
called by the town crier. The letter which a wife was
not ashamed to send to her husband may be sung
up and down the parade, for all I care! Listen to this,
Nan Day: you led your husband a pretty dance once
upon a time, but split me, you stopped short of public
insult! Listen, Lady Flora. All the world knows what
a treasure Dare-Stamer has in you and how ’tis the
good humour of the world you have with him, and the
patience! Here’s a message for a wife to write to her
husband:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“<i>My dear Denis, Her Majesty has most graciously
condoned the dreadful Act of Disrespect by which you made
an exhibition of yourself and of another person who shall
be nameless, at a moment, when the Horrid Spectacle could
not fail to meet her August Glance, in so far as not to
withdraw her condescending promise to be present at my
Ball to-morrow night. She has, nevertheless, given me to
understand with Her own incomparable Tact and Kindness
that should you find it convenient to be absent on business
on that occasion it would considerably add to the harmony
of the evening. I am sure I need only convey this expression
of her Royal pleasure to you, that you are not so
altogether lost to decency and good feeling as not instantly
to take steps to meet it. Pray believe me, my Lord, to
remain your attached and dutiful Wife——</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Denis’s voice shook and broke with a sound that
approached a snarl, on the last words.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that? What do you think of
it?” he shouted, shaking the letter, first under Lady
Flora’s, then under Nan Day’s nose.</p>

<p>Both ladies looked scared.</p>

<p>“Dear! dear!” said Lady Flora, “I’m sure ’tis vastly
disagreeable all round, but—well, there, my good soul,
wouldn’t it help matters if you was just to do as the
Queen asks? La! she’s so prodigious stiff-backed.
And who should know it but me! Didn’t I nearly die of
being Lady of the Bedchamber for three mortal months.
Oh, I’m too fat and soft for Her Majesty, but sure, it’ll all
blow over, and you so good-natured yourself, and so
obliging!”</p>

<p>“I’m sure,” said Nan, stepping up to Kitty, and turning
a fierce blue eye on my Lord, “I don’t know what you
mean about leading my Philip a dance, my Lord Kilcroney.
Whatever points of difference there may have
been between us, they’ve been private ones, and my
husband, sir, is a gentleman of high principles and good
conduct, and if I were not all a wife should be to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
I should be, indeed, the basest of women; but were I——”
she suddenly began to shake and tremble upon tears—“were
I wedded to one who outraged my tenderest
feelings, offended my dignity in public, made a mock of
the most solemn vows, and—and——” she flung her arms
round Kitty and clasped her, sobbing.</p>

<p>Her emotion was contagious. Kitty burst into tears
on the spot.</p>

<p>“May you never know what it means, my sweet Nan.
May your heart never be broken!”</p>

<p>The two clung together, sobbing as for a wager, and
Lady Flora, whisking out a capable handkerchief, sniffed
and begged them, with reddening eyelids, to stop for
mercy’s sake.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Kilcroney! Don’t, Nan! I’m so soft!
You’ll have me off too. I never could bear to see anyone
cry.”</p>

<p>Even Pamela, kneeling beside her bandbox, flung a
gaze of deep reproach upon the sinner. She knew something
of the story: her aunt was one who liked to retail
a bit of spicy gossip when it came her way.</p>

<p>The weight of this feminine condemnation was too much
for the unhappy Denis, but his wrath was unabated.</p>

<p>“Vastly well, my Lady. Vastly well,” he cried,
thrusting the crumpled note into his pocket. “I’ll off
with myself, aye, and I’ll take this love token with me.
I’ll not pollute your party, never fear; but whatever you
hear of me, now, remember, you drove me to it.”</p>

<p>Denis Kilcroney fulfilled his dark threat by going
straight to the confectioner’s shop, over which Mrs.
Lafone had taken modest lodgings. He found her in
company with her brother-in-law, Ned Stafford. That
gentleman was lying, as much at his ease as he could in
the only arm-chair, which was, however, hard and slippery,
being covered with horsehair. His hands were joined by
the finger-tips, his eyes were closed. With a resigned lift
of eyebrow he was listening to the little lady’s shrill and
voluble harangue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>Mistress Molly, in a white muslin morning wrapper tied
round her slim waist by an azure blue ribbon, with silver
fair hair, scarcely powdered, all unbound, save for where
a knot of the same blue caught the curls at the nape of
her neck, looked perhaps only the more attractive because
her eyes and cheeks blazed with anger. And it was, my
Lord Kilcroney saw with relief, a dry anger; for his
Kitty, playing the victim while exercising such—yes!
dash it, the only word was spite!—had added exasperation
to his sense of injury.</p>

<p>“Come in, come in, my Lord,” Mistress Molly wheeled
upon him with a laugh, if Denis could only have recognised
the fact, more full of spite than his Lady’s utmost petulance.
“Pray have you heard what I’ve been saying?
Oh, you needn’t blink at me like that, Brother Stafford,
I’ll say it all over again. I’ll say that my Lady Kilcroney
is the most jealous cat in the whole of England. She has
left me out of her royal ball, has she? I’m not virtuous
enough! What, my Lord, you kissed my wrist on the
parade—and if I say it was my wrist, Tom Stafford?
I ought to know! and Kitty—oh, the virtuous Kitty!—and
her old cross Royal thought to see the kind of shocking
spectacle your virtuous people are fond of thinking they
see. My Lady was always jealous of poor little me!
I don’t care who hears me. I say—hold your tongue,
Tom!—’tis a conspiracy, ’tis a scandal. I’ll make Mr.
Lafone tell His Royal Highness all about it. I’ll go to
law on it. There can’t be more scandal about me than
there will be for being the only one of the ladies at Weymouth
left out to-morrow night!”</p>

<p>Mr. Stafford, who had been glinting at Denis
between his bored eyelids, now opened them a fraction
wider.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, good lad,” said he, “get her a
ticket.”</p>

<p>“Get her one yourself.”</p>

<p>“My good Kil, your Lady does not even know that
I’m in Weymouth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“Why then, you’ve but got to show yourself. You’re
not her husband,” added Kilcroney bitterly.</p>

<p>“Not at all!” cried Mr. Stafford, with some energy.
“It shall never be said that I have set myself to curry
favour with Kitty Kilcroney, more especially since ’tis
my own sister-in-law that she’s treating so uncivil. Nay,
Kil, I’ll keep out of it. I’m only giving you a bit of advice
for your own sake. Get her a ticket. ’Twill save a lot
of bother in the end. And I do assure you,” as Denis
laughed hollowly, “’Twill have an excellent effect on
society generally. There has been far too much fuss
about an incident which should have been—ahem!—passed
over!”</p>

<p>Lord Kilcroney dropped upon the horsehair sofa,
which creaked dismally.</p>

<p>“And pray,” said he, in a tone of sarcasm, “when you
had dealings with my Lady yourself—and you had a
few, one way and another—did you find her so easy to
manage?”</p>

<p>Now Mr. Stafford had somewhere hidden away an old
grudge against Lady Kilcroney, who had not only jilted him,
but had scored off him notably on more than one occasion.
Mr. Stafford was far from approving of Molly, whom,
indeed, it may be said, he heartily disliked, but to find a
close relative pilloried on your arrival at a fashionable
watering-place was a set down to a beau’s pride. He
was inclined to champion her. Under his languid airs he
was very wroth with my Lady Kilcroney; she was making
an indelicate fuss; she had lost her usual tactful grasp
of the situation through ridiculous jealousy. After all,
as Kilcroney himself represented, there couldn’t have
been much harm in a kiss bestowed on the open parade
in a high wind; between wrist or cheek like enough
there was a confusion by one or other of the parties.
But Kilcroney’s next remark made him jump to his feet.</p>

<p>“As for a ticket for the show, me lad, I’m not to
have one, either.”</p>

<p>“Kil!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“My Lord!”</p>

<p>Molly broke into shriller laughter, and beat her palms
together.</p>

<p>“And His Royal Highness coming and all!”</p>

<p>“Aye, and by the same token I saw that august
personage driving his curricle along the sea road on my
way here,” said Mr. Stafford, relapsing into his usual
rather insolent serenity. Your fine gentleman will not
let himself be betrayed into emotion if he can help it.</p>

<p>“And I was less flattered than ever at your taking me
for him yesterday, Kil.”</p>

<p>His sister-in-law looked at him curiously. “But my
Lord Kilcroney is right!” she cried maliciously. “Since
you’ve grown so prodigious fat, brother-in-law.”</p>

<p>Then, having planted the pin-prick which she never
allowed to escape her, she returned to the real subject of
interest.</p>

<p>“Not to be present at your own wife’s entertainment?
Oh come, my Lord, this is an Irish way of evading the
question. You must think us monstrous simple to
credit——”</p>

<p>It was a morning of interruptions, for here Miss Pounce
and the bandboxes marched unexpectedly in upon them.
She was breathing quickly and speaking with volubility.</p>

<p>My Lady Verney’s own woman had informed her of
Mrs. Lafone’s address in the town, and she had ventured
to present herself with the very latest, positively the very
latest, to show to her most esteemed customers. Miss
Pounce was quite sure that Mistress Lafone and Mistress
Stafford—“Is your lady here, sir?” she curtsied to the
Beau, who was ogling her jocosely. “Not till next week?
Oh, dear, what a pity! I’d have been honoured, sir, to
supply a hat or a head for the beautiful Mrs. Stafford.
But as I was saying, I am quite sure that you, Madam,
and your sister, being such kind patrons of the establishment,
Madame Mirabel would have taken it very bad of
me, very bad of me indeed, had I failed to seek you out.”</p>

<p>Denis Kilcroney was sitting erect upon the sofa, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
his arms folded, and a stern glance upon the glib Pamela.
This young person avoided meeting the glance in question.
She felt that her swift appearance at Mrs. Lafone’s lodgings
on the heels of my Lord’s stormy exit was, for all her
clever patter, a little too obvious a coincidence.</p>

<p>“I’ve a head here,” went on Miss Pounce, beginning
to set down her bandboxes, and making the most
theatrical effects with the undoing of strings and rustling
of tissue paper. “Well, <i>really</i>, the Duchess of Hampshire
wanted, right or wrong, to have it for her ball last week
when she entertained the Prince, as you may have seen
by the news-sheet, Madam. But I says to her, ‘No,
your Grace,’ I says, ‘’tis too elfin for your Grace. Your
Grace wants, so to speak, the Goddess effect.’ And as I
says it, if you’ll believe me, I thought of you, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lafone did not believe her, but she stood, hesitating
a little, over the bandboxes, torn between a pettish
desire to dismiss with obloquy the wretch who had come
to turn the dagger in the wound, and the budding hope
that Mr. Stafford, who had plenty of money, might be
moved to do the generous for once, and present his injured
sister-in-law with a token of his esteem.</p>

<p>Miss Pounce drew out what was indeed a fairy-like
wreath of pale blue convolvulus, and Molly exclaimed in
rapture. In a wink Miss Pounce had placed it on the
fair, dishevelled head.</p>

<p>“Oh, Madam, if ever there was a perfect vision! Look,
Mr. Stafford, Sir! Look, my Lord, if I may make so
bold; isn’t Mrs. Lafone fitted, so to speak, like a—like
a——” She faltered on the simile, for neither gentlemen
showed any disposition to rise to the occasion.</p>

<p>My Lord cast another glance upon the milliner, which
said as plain as words: “Don’t think you can take me in,
my good girl,” and then, with a formal bow to the syren
and a wave of the hand to Stafford, he sauntered out of
the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Stafford flung a glance of mocking pity after him,
whistling a ballad tune under his breath; then he put his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
hand into his pocket, but it was only to produce a snuffbox,
from which he proceeded to inhale.</p>

<p>Molly pettishly tore the wreath from her curls, declaring
in her most acrid accents:</p>

<p>“Really, Miss Pounce, this is a great liberty. I can
order my hats for myself when I require them, and then
I usually write to Madame Eglantine, in Paris. And
anyhow, I am not going into society by doctor’s orders.
I am here for my health. Pray, Mr. Stafford, will you
pull the bell rope, that Madame Mirabel’s assistant may
be shown to the door.”</p>

<p>Miss Pounce started to re-pack the wreath, with further
extraordinary manipulations of tissue paper. She was
all bland apology. She craved a hundred pardons. She
had made so sure that Mrs. Lafone would be going to my
Lady Kilcroney’s ball at the Assembly Rooms to-morrow
night. She hoped and trusted it would be as great a
success as the Duchess of Hampshire’s last week, and
that His Royal Highness would be equally delighted
with his entertainment. “Though of course——” here
the milliner genteelly tittered, “it was not likely he would
be equally demonstrative to his hostess. Was it possible
Madame had not heard how His Royal Highness, saying
‘It is a Sovereign’s privilege to salute another Sovereign,
and you are Queen of Beauty,’ had kissed her Grace of
Hampshire on the cheek after the minuet—Oh, indeed,
she had danced like an angel, and looked exceedingly
well—before the whole assembly?”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said Mr. Stafford, with humorous
meaning.</p>

<p>“And I’m sure, I hope,” cried acrid Molly, “that His
Royal Highness may be as prodigal of caress to my Lady
Kilcroney. Oh!” she cried, clasping her hands, “if that
is the kind of fit that’s on him, and he was to kiss my
sweetest Kitty before his Royal Mamma and the lovely
Princesses, what a monstrous joke it would be.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Stafford stepped forward and opened the door.</p>

<p>“Allow me, my dear,” said he, and with what Pamela<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
thought an insufferable free-and-easiness, lifted her bandboxes
one after the other into the passage, and literally
bowed her out.</p>

<p>She stood, snapping her fingers and biting her nails,
to linger and listen as long as she dared. Up to this she
had after all but poor gleanings to bring back to her
Aunt Lydia for the retailing into her patroness’s ear, save,
indeed, the sad verification of my Lord’s presence in the
Minx’s lodgings. But she saw that she was suspected
by one, if not both, of the gentlemen, and however necessary
it is for a young milliner to make quite certain that
the cords of her boxes are properly tied, it is not an
operation that can be prolonged indefinitely. Some
phrases she did catch.</p>

<p>“The joke of it is that the Prince,” Mr. Stafford was
observing.</p>

<p>The rest of the remark was lost; it was followed by a
crow from Molly Lafone.</p>

<p>“Not to be there, after all? Serve her right!”
Then in another tone. “Oh, I have the drollest inspiration!”</p>

<p>“Hush!”</p>

<p>Pounce pricked her ear to its utmost alertness.</p>

<p>“I have the drollest inspiration,” said Mrs. Lafone.
“Since you say, Tom, you’re poz that His Royal Highness
don’t mean to attend my Lady’s ball—and I say it serves
her right—why should you not go in his stead?”</p>

<p>“Go in his stead?” Mr. Stafford blankly repeated
then. “You’re crazy, Molly!”</p>

<p>“And not at all! Oh, it can be managed, I do assure
you! Oh, it would be too droll, too delightful! And it
would be better than droll, for ’twould be a certain way
to heal the breach, the sad, sad breach between our poor
Kil and that same jealous Kitty. Pray, Brother-in-law,
before you interrupt, let me speak one word! Kitty’s
Royals, King, Queen and Princesses, will but pass through
the Assembly Rooms. ’Tis the way of Royalty. ’Tis
all anyone would expect of them, more especially as His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
Majesty is so out of health. What is to prevent the
Prince changing his mind, and popping in for late supper?
By the Prince, I mean you, Tom. Come now, you know
’tis a thing he might do very well. People would only
say he could not bear the tedium of dancing at his Royal
parents’ heels. Come now, Mr. Stafford, sir. I see it in
your eye. You know ’tis a trick could be played on my
Lady with perfect success? Oh, you need not present
yourself on the scene till every one should have departed,
save the select little circle, those sweet, dear, charming
ladies and their stupid husbands, who won’t have anything
to say to poor little me! And then, oh, Mr. Stafford,
you must be monstrous charmed, and monstrous gallant,
and—well, monstrous tipsy if you like, and you will but
the closer ape our dear future Sovereign! And then
(oh, how you gape!) don’t you see? You must kiss my
Lady, and if she don’t have to forgive my Lord afterwards——”</p>

<p>“Foh!” said Mr. Stafford. “’Tis the rankest nonsense.
And I’m not so prodigious like the Prince as all that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you are, Mr. Stafford! Didn’t my Lord
Kilcroney take you for him but yesterday? With one
of those new white chokers, and a frill to the shirt, and a
bit of blue ribbon across it and a new wig with a top-knot
to it, and a fine brocade waistcoat on your fine figure—you
were always so clever at the acting, Brother-in-law!—I’d
defy even your Prue to find you out!”</p>

<p>Mr. Stafford was apparently unconvinced, for Molly
Lafone’s accents changed from wheedling to taunting.</p>

<p>“And indeed, Tom, I thought you’d more spirit. Here
I give you such a chance as never was of paying my Lady
out for the trick she played on you. Why, she made you
the laughing-stock of Bath. Oh, I have heard such droll
tales—how, rather than marry you, she made my Lord—Denis
O’Hara, as he was then—dress up as a woman and
pretend to be your previous wife at the altar steps. Are
you so mean-spirited as to forget? And ’tisn’t as if it
wouldn’t be the best turn in the world for my Lord, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
him so good-natured, and treated so shameful! I thought
gentlemen stood by each other. For a wife to insult her
husband so!”</p>

<p>“It mightn’t put me in such very good odour with
His Royal Highness,” said Mr. Stafford, and Pamela knew
by his tone that he was faltering.</p>

<p>“As if anyone was likely to tell him. However, if
you’re afraid, Brother-in-law——”</p>

<p>“You’re a little devil,” said Mr. Stafford.</p>

<p>And Pamela picked up her boxes and flew. She had
heard enough, and she knew that Mistress Lafone had
carried her point.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In which Kitty is more Incomparable Than Ever</span></p>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Good</span> God!” said Nan Day, under her breath. “If
that is not the Lafone piece! My dearest Kitty, what
insolence!”</p>

<p>“I invited her,” said my Lady Kilcroney, quietly.</p>

<p>“Kitty!”</p>

<p>“By special messenger to-day.”</p>

<p>“Kitty!!!”</p>

<p>“I particularly wished for the presence of Mrs. Lafone
here to-night.”</p>

<p>The syren was now approaching, crowned with the
very wreath she had cast back at Pamela Pounce, writhing
like a lissome snake, in the billows and laces of her changing
sea-green ball gown. Nan watched Kitty’s urbanity,
and the minx’s unconcealed impertinence with ever-growing
amazement.</p>

<p>“Am I too late to see the dear, dear Royals?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately their Majesties stayed but a short
time. The King was feeling unwell.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dearest Lady Kilcroney, what a disappointment
for you!”</p>

<p>Kitty had a tilting smile.</p>

<p>“Less to me than to other people, perhaps, my dear
Lafone, since I have the privilege of being so constantly
in Their Majesties’ company.”</p>

<p>“True, true. It must be a sad fatigue for you. Her
Majesty has no mercy on her ladies’ legs, I always heard.”
The minx’s eyes were wandering. “But His Royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
Highness has remained, I trust? ’Twas the talk of the
place how he was expected.”</p>

<p>“His Royal Highness has left Weymouth, I understand.”</p>

<p>Kitty was really too unconcerned. It could take in
nobody, Lady Anne Day thought. She bit into a rose
of her bouquet, and wished she could beat Lafone about
the head with it.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dearest Lady Kilcroney, who could have told
you such a tale? His Royal Highness is even now
sitting at the window of the County Club, eating lobster
by the light of a silver candelabra. I saw him as my
chair was carried by. Surely he will present himself at
supper time? The Prince is always so courteous, so
considerate.”</p>

<p>“Pray, Mrs. Lafone, the quadrille is beginning. Have
you a partner? Or shall I provide you with a gentleman?”</p>

<p>Molly rolled her glistening green eyes with well-feigned
anxiety from side to side.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s an old promise to my Lord Kilcroney.
He made me swear to give him the first dance at the
next assembly, wherever we might happen to meet. Ah—is
he not yonder? Nay, ’tis quite another countenance.
But he will be at your Ladyship’s side in a moment, I
make no doubt.”</p>

<p>“My Lord has left Weymouth.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dearest Lady Kilcroney, what a sad, strange
contretemps!”</p>

<p>Even as she spoke that green eye became fixed. One
of Kitty’s magnificent footmen was approaching, bearing
a letter on a salver. My Lady read it, glanced at Mrs.
Lafone, and then turned to Lady Ann: “The Prince is
coming, after all, Nan. How strange—” she turned
back to Molly—“that you should this moment have
suggested the possibility.”</p>

<p>Mistress Lafone had recognised in a single flash the
great folded sheet that she had herself prepared and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
sealed with so much amusement, to the accompaniment
of the protests of the rather doubtful, yet not altogether
unwilling Beau. The seal had been Molly’s triumph.
What will not a determined woman accomplish? She
had actually got possession of the kind of wafer habitually
used by the Prince. Like mistress, like maid, it is said:
Mistress Molly’s own maid was as much of a minx as her
mistress. She had started flirtations with every likely
scoundrel about Weymouth before she had been a fortnight
in the place. One of the drawers at the Crown Inn
had thought it a small price to pay for the smiles of Jenny
Jinks to give her, as a keepsake, a few wafers out of the
Prince’s own ivory box, off the writing-table in the room
occupied by His Royal Highness.</p>

<p>“The Prince coming after all!” cried Nan Day joyfully.
She was genuinely fond of Kitty, but even if she
had not been so, to see Lafone discomfited would have
been delightful to her.</p>

<p>This latter was seized with a fit of tittering, and was
fain to retire, fanning herself violently and simulating a
threat of the vapours.</p>

<p>Lady Ann looked after her contemptuously.</p>

<p>“She can hardly conceal her spite,” quoth she. “Ah,
Kitty, I believe you knew the Prince was coming all the
while, and that was why you invited that little rascal!”</p>

<p>Kitty had upon this, as even the obtuse Nan could
not but notice, a singular smile.</p>

<p>Certainly it would have been a thousand pities had
my Lady Kilcroney’s entertainment fallen flat, for never
had even her bright wits and long purse made more
charming and sumptuous preparations.</p>

<p>The Assembly Rooms had been transmogrified into a
fairy bower, with hangings of white silk, and garlands of
roses. The band was surpassing itself: the supper, no
doubt, would be unsurpassable. There was a special
supper-room prepared off the great ball-room, where, it
was hinted, such delicacies would be served as would
tickle the jaded palate of the Prince. If he had not come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
’twould have been a catastrophe. Yes, positively a
catastrophe for my Lady Kilcroney.</p>

<p>The moment approached for the appearance of the
Royal guest. The most pompous of the company had
taken its departure closely upon the heels of Royalty,
and now there was left none but that select circle to
which Mistress Lafone had referred with so much acrimony,
and a sprinkling of young naval officers, quite
negligible beings.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, one of these was now to suit Mistress
Molly’s purpose very well. Most unaccountably, she,
who was generally surrounded by the male sex, found
herself neglected to-night by the gentlemen of Kitty’s
coterie. Perhaps her mermaid charms seemed more
dangerous than alluring after the trap into which my
Lord Kilcroney had fallen. Anyway, she was glad to
hang upon the arm of a blushing youth in blue, and the
celebrated band striking up “God save the Prince of
Wales” with a great stroke of bows, planted herself
with her cavalier near the entrance to watch, her heart
beating high with ecstasy and fear—for the appearance
of brother-in-law Tom as the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>A stout gentleman, in the very pink of the fashion, with
all his double chins majestically sunk in swathes of fine
cambric, with ruffles, blue ribbon and a star, with calves
that must have made Kitty’s footmen green with envy,
and shoulders that would have been remarkable in a
guardsman, advanced, stepping with the inimitable
carriage of the great.</p>

<p>Again an hysterical burst of laughter rose in Molly’s
throat. The next moment she pinched the arm of the
young naval gentleman so fiercely that he turned in
alarm.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?”</p>

<p>“I am swooning!” said Molly with a gasp, and swoon
she did, and no mistake about it!</p>

<p>However cunningly Mr. Stafford might make himself
up, however paint and pad and be-wig himself, strut and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
look majestic, he could not have given to his handsome
brown eyes the dull protruding stare, nor to his features
that thickness which a plethoric habit was inducing in the
heir to the throne; and Mr. Stafford would not have
been escorted by the gentlemen of the Prince’s own suite;
and, most certain of all, he would not have had my Lord
Kilcroney by his side.</p>

<p>The dreadful discovery flashed upon the unfortunate
Molly with the still more appalling realisation that the
next few minutes must inevitably see the bogus Prince
present himself on the heels of the genuine one; and that
all would be discovered, to the everlasting undoing of
those concerned.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I have but the time to warn him!” she thought;
when Nemesis overtook her in the shape of that real
swoon.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“You go on slapping her hands, auntie, while I burn
another feather. Dear, to be sure, don’t she look bad!
Downright silly, I call it, for ladies to be lacing themselves
so tight, and she as thin as a fish to begin with! I
declare, when I cut those green laces, they regular popped.”</p>

<p>As through layers of swirling mist which both blinded
and deafened her, Mrs. Lafone vaguely caught these
words. Another voice penetrated more sharply to her
growing consciousness.</p>

<p>“And if you was to pull yourself in a bit, Pamela,
you’d look a deal more genteel. A well-looking girl like
you, with all your advantages and gowned, I will say that
for you, with uncommon taste, to go about with such a
milkmaid figure! I’d drink a tablespoonful of white
vinegar night and morning, if I was you. Drat! How
green she do keep! Slap a bit harder, child. I’m all
of a dither to get into that little balcony that overlooks
the supper-room, and see my Lady and His Highness
and all.”</p>

<p>“A balcony, is there?” Pamela’s pleasant accents
questioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“Yes, my dear, and you can come along with me, once
we get the life back into Madam. A minstrels’ gallery
they call it, overlooking the hall. Oh, I had a peep just
now when I ran for the hartshorn. ’Tis the elegantest
spectacle you ever saw; to look down on the supper
table was like fairyland. Ain’t she sighed? She was
always an aggravating piece,” said the elder Miss Pounce
with some asperity.</p>

<p>Molly lay with closed eyes and fully recovered wits.
She was debating whether to prolong the fit and let herself
be carried back seemingly unconscious to her lodgings,
would not be the best way out of an unpleasant dilemma.
It would annoy these two impertinent females: that was
an added advantage.</p>

<p>“Was they already at table when you looked in on
them, auntie?” asked Madame Mirabel’s partner, between
two brisk smacks of Mrs. Lafone’s palm.</p>

<p>“They was, my dear. Well, since there don’t seem
to be a mite of use trying to get her to swallow anything,
I’ll have that drop of ratafia myself. It sort of turns
me to see people that colour—they was all a-sitting round
the supper table, His Highness beside my Lady, and my
Lord with Lady Flo, and just the rest of my Lady’s
intimates. The supper table looking beautiful with the
best gold plate. And them red, red roses my Lady paid
such a sum for. And the Prince’s top-knot shining lovely,
and your wreath—’twas the naturallest thing; you could
have sworn the dew had just fallen on it! But my Lady
Anne’s blue turban’s a trifle heavy for my taste, Pam.
She was a-sitting rather glum, I thought, but perhaps
that was because she didn’t have her gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Her gentleman?”</p>

<p>“My Lady was counting on Mr. Stafford——”</p>

<p>There was a double cry.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stafford!” screamed Pamela and Mrs. Lafone
together. Pamela dropped the hand she was slapping
with such good will, and Mrs. Lafone sat bolt upright.</p>

<p>“Did you say my Lady was expecting Mr. Stafford?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
asked Pamela. She was in such amazement she could
not give a thought to the patient’s miraculous recovery.</p>

<p>“Well, and upon my word, and why should not my
Lady invite Mr. Stafford? What’s took you? And as
for you, ma’am, if ever I see a lady come out of a swound
as you have sudden-like this minute——”</p>

<p>But the invalid interrupted, rising to her feet, clasping
her dishevelled head with both hands, and staring from
one to the other, as if she or they were mad.</p>

<p>“When was Mr. Stafford invited? What do you
know about his having been expected? Heavens,
woman, answer me! ’Tis a matter of life and death
for me.”</p>

<p>“Mercy on us! Shall you be giving us the screaming
vapours next, ma’am? I happen to know—if you must
have it—that my Lady only heard of his presence in
Weymouth at seven of the clock this evening, and nothing
would serve her but he must be sent to that instant
minute.”</p>

<p>“Take me to the balcony you spoke of,” said Mrs.
Lafone, in an extinct voice.</p>

<p>Her clothes were hanging off her back, as Lydia shockedly
pointed out; and her hair was a sight for the crows;
and my Lady had only given leave for her own woman
(though she wouldn’t mind Pam); Lydia felt sure she
wouldn’t, so to speak, care about people as isn’t asked to
the supper party, spying on His Highness in that common
kind of way!</p>

<p>But Mrs. Lafone produced a gold piece with so much
promptitude that her bodice was pinned together, her
mantle brought, and her still tottering steps guided to
the upper passage and to the gallery in a remarkably
short space of time. The balcony was filled with palms
and flowering plants. If anyone had thought of looking
up, and chanced to see the narrow, white face and fiery
eyes peering down at them, they might have thought
some witch had flown in on her broomstick to cast a baleful
spell upon the cheerful company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>The two Miss Pounces quite forgot their uncomfortable
companion in the thrilling interest of the scene. Lively
were the whispers they exchanged across the stem of a
stout tree fern.</p>

<p>“La, aunt, if that isn’t Mr. Stafford down there, as
cool as a cucumber! Well, to be sure; ain’t the world
a strange place?”</p>

<p>“Cool he always was, as nobody knows better than
me. The way he on and off with that poor piece, Madame
Eglantine, when she kept a milliner’s shop at Bath, and
proposing to my Lady all the while, and she the rich
widow Bellairs. Well—cucumbers was not in it.”</p>

<p>Pamela Pounce was craning eagerly forward. Certainly
to see Mr. Stafford <i>in propria persona</i> sitting
genially in the company of the Prince, the guest of my
Lady Kilcroney, after conspiring to humiliate and confound
her, was the last development she had expected of
the night’s drama.</p>

<p>That my Lord Kilcroney should be playing host to the
wife who had with contumely dismissed him was another
matter, Miss Pamela Pounce was by no means so amazed
to see him sitting at the supper table as Mrs. Lafone had
been to see him walk in.</p>

<p>“The little cat,” thought Pam, “’twas a real fit, sure
enough, and serve her right. She ain’t succeeded this
time—though she came near enough to it—in separating
the elegantest couple in all society. What a good thing
it is, Pam my girl,” (she was fond of apostrophising herself
thus) “that you ain’t too squeamish to do a bit of
spying in season and listen outside doors.”</p>

<p>“His Royal Highness is taking a glass of wine with Mr.
Stafford,” whispered Lydia sibilantly, in a prodigious
state of excitement.</p>

<p>Pamela felt an abrupt movement beside her, and
glancing round, beheld Mrs. Lafone darting from the
gallery like a snake disturbed. The girl drew a long
breath. The air was easier to her lungs now that this
miasma of malice was removed from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>His Royal Highness was most agreeably and flatteringly
inebriated at the end of Kitty’s supper party. He declared
thickly that it had been a most delightful evening.
If he did not salute her cheek with his royal lips as he had
saluted the Duchess of Hampshire, he mumbled her hand
with repeated kisses. But Kitty’s triumph was not yet
complete. Its culminating point was only reached when
she found herself with my Lord back in the withdrawing-room
of her lodgings, accompanied on her express invitation,
by Mr. Stafford.</p>

<p>She flung off her wraps and, standing in the middle of
the room, with rather a tearful smile, held out a hand to
each.</p>

<p>“Denis, my love—Stafford, my old friend—we have,
each of us, I dare say, things against each other to forgive
and forget, but for my part ’tis all done with already.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my Lady Kilcroney. Ah, Kitty!” cried the
Beau, moved out of his wont, and pressing the little hand
against his breast, before lifting it to his lips, “When I
received your note warning me of the ass I would be
making of myself in trying to get the better of you, I
thought—dash me, I thought—there’s not a woman in
the world to compare to her for generosity and wit! And
how, in the name of God, did you know, Kitty?” he
cried, with a change of tone. “’Pon my soul, never tell
me that piece, Molly, betrayed me for an invitation?”</p>

<p>“By no means, sir, the invitation was sent to her—well!
as a little punishment. She came all agog to see
my discomfiture, and Lydia, my woman, tells me she was
so overset at the sight of His Highness that she swooned.”</p>

<p>My Lord by this time had an arm about his wife’s
waist.</p>

<p>“’Twas I told me wife,” said he in his richest brogue,
“of your dastardly plot, me fine fellow.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Ay, meself and no other.”</p>

<p>“But this is mystery upon mystery,” said Mr. Stafford,
and he was really mystified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“A little bird told me,” said Kilcroney, wagging his
head.</p>

<p>Kitty interrupted, laughing.</p>

<p>“Aye, and by the way, my Lord, ring the bell and send
Pompey for that very little bird. She must not go unrewarded.”</p>

<p>“She?” repeated Mr. Stafford. His eyebrows went
up. He was perhaps not altogether amazed to see Pamela
Pounce walk into the room.</p>

<p>“Come here, child,” said my Lady, and picked from
her bodice a pretty, sparkling brooch. “Wear this for
my sake in remembrance of to-night. As for me,” her
light voice deepened, “I shall never forget your good
sense and courage. She guessed you were planning some
mischief with your charming sister-in-law, Mr. Stafford,
sir, and having to tie her bandboxes outside the door, she
caught some whispers of your little game.”</p>

<p>“Oho!” said Mr. Stafford.</p>

<p>“I listened,” cried Pamela with flaming cheeks, “and
I went straight to my Lord here and my Lord——”</p>

<p>Here my Lord himself took up the tale, his lazy, pleasant
voice creaming forth in contrast to the excited tones of
the young milliner.</p>

<p>“And faith, bad husband as I am—troth, sure it’s the
worst in the world—there was but one thing for me to do,
and that was to protect me wife. So I went to His Royal
Highness and did a little bit of coaxing—not that he needed
much. God bless him, isn’t he always ready to condescend
to be entertained? And I got him to promise easy
enough to come in to supper after his royal parents had
gone to bed. And then I wrote a line to my Lady and
asked her permission to bring the Prince, and by the same
token I told her about your fine scheme of counterfeit.
Sure, I knew my Lady could be trusted to deal with that.”</p>

<p>“Denis,” said Kitty. “There was an infamous note
I sent you on pink paper. Have you got it about you?”</p>

<p>He gave her a grim look, inserted two fingers into his
waistcoat pocket, and drew it forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“Give it back to me, my dear love.”</p>

<p>“Why, I was thinking ’twouldn’t be a bad token for
me to keep about me, lest I should be meeting some
sorrowful young creature that wanted comforting on a
parade——”</p>

<p>“Oh, my Lord, don’t mock me.”</p>

<p>She twitched it from his hand and began to tear it into
a hundred shreds. Then, between laughing and crying,
she gathered in her turn a little note from her bosom.</p>

<p>“’Tis you that are generous, ’tis you that are forgiving,
my Lord. How could I keep up petty malice, Mr. Stafford
when my Denis had treated me so gallant? This letter,”
cried Kitty, kissing it, “shall be my treasure till I die.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In which the Mad Brat takes the Bit between<br>
Her Teeth, but Miss Pamela Pounce Keeps Hold<br>
of the Reins</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first stage between Weymouth and London brought
Miss Pamela Pounce to Blandford where she intended to
pass the night. She had spent an agreeable and lucrative
week at Weymouth, whither the presence of Royalty
had brought a host of fashionables, and where it had
been easy for her to dispose of all the modish hats and
heads, caps and toques which she had selected to tempt
holiday appetites.</p>

<p>With a light conscience and heavy pockets, therefore,
Pamela was setting off for London in finest spirits. She
had brought more than her usual zest to this journey
who always enjoyed travelling to the full; the movement,
the change of scene, the bustle at arrival and
departure, the choice of the night’s lodging, the chance
adventure, the shifting company, all stimulated, interested,
delighted her. She could take care of herself,
and had no fear, either of the rare highwayman, or of the
intrusive gallant.</p>

<p>The “Rover” deposited its burden with a fine flourish
of horn and whip and clatter of hoofs, tick on time, in
the cobbled courtyard of the Crown Inn at Blandford.</p>

<p>Six of the clock had just been huskily beaten out
behind the great white dial that surmounted the celebrated
stables. The jolly coachman turned half round
in his seat, and winked at the gentleman in the many-caped
roquelaure who had entertained him with such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
racy gossip for five hours that day, and who had not
failed moreover, to season their conversation with a
brimmer at every halting place.</p>

<p>“What do you think o’ that for punctuality, my
Lord?”</p>

<p>Now “my Lord” was a mere fluke—shot at quality,
but for once it had hit the bull’s eye.</p>

<p>The traveller, descending with care from the coach
(for the last tankard had been tightly laced and required
some carrying) was nearly run into by a brisk young
lady in a grey riding coat, and black satin hat, who
exclaimed genteelly: “To be sure, sir, I crave your
pardon!” And then cried: “My Lord Kilcroney, is it
indeed you!”</p>

<p>“Why, ’tis never Miss Pounce!” exclaimed my Lord,
surveying her, as if the last thing wanting to his joviality
had now been granted him by Fate. And, indeed, not
only was Pamela Pounce vastly pleasing to look upon—she
had something of the firmness, the clear red-and-white
and the general appetising appearance of a white-heart
cherry—but she was vastly agreeable company too, as
he had found out on more than one occasion. Added to
which, she had recently done him a very good turn with
his lady, as sometimes comes in the way of milliners and
such like who collect back-door gossip, and exercise back-door
influence. Withal, which certainly spoilt nothing,
she was a young person of merit; virtuous, responsible,
and discreet. My Lord knew that she would take at
their proper value any little compliment or other expression
of esteem, such as the squeeze of a trim waist,
an absent-minded clasp of taper fingers, even a snatched
kiss. He might get a box on the ear; he would never be
treated either to outraged sensibility, or—still more
inconvenient contingency—an undesired responsiveness.</p>

<p>He held Miss Pounce’s hand, and smiled down into her
bright face with something approaching enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Split me, my dear, but this is a piece of good luck.
And I who thought I’d be all at my lonesome over——”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
he stopped, and sniffed. “What is it?—the beef-steak
pudding, and the roast capons to-night. I invite you
to supper with me, Pamela. I sent my rascal ahead to
bespeak the little oak parlour on the garden, and——”</p>

<p>“Thanking you kindly, my Lord,” said Miss Pounce,
disengaging her hand, and speaking with great firmness,
“I dine with no gentleman in the back parlour.”</p>

<p>His merry face fell.</p>

<p>“How now, so prudish?”</p>

<p>“Nay, my Lord, merely prudent. ’Tis as much as
my reputation is worth. The ladies wouldn’t like it.
No, nor the landladies. The common room is best for
a common working girl like me.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Lord Kilcroney, “’tis an uncommon
girl you are. You’re in the right of it a thousand
times. Faith, my Lady would be ready to tear the wig
from my head if she heard of it!”</p>

<p>“And she’d tear my hats from hers, and that would
be vastly the greater calamity of the two, forgive me for
saying so, my Lord.”</p>

<p>“See here,” said he, “I’ll face the bagmen for the
pleasure of your conversation, for, odd’s my life, you’ve
a sparkle about you that’s as good as champagne after
the dreary road! I’ll tell them to lay your place beside
mine in the coffee-room, and you’ll season my supper to
me with that spicy tongue of yours.”</p>

<p>Pamela said she was a poor girl, and she hoped she
knew her place, that my Lord was vastly condescending,
and that she’d have to take what seat was given her;
which remarks, my Lord, rightly understanding to be an
oblique acceptance, greeted with laughter and applause,
and went gaily towards the inn after her, admiring her
generous, well-knit shape, and taking off his hat with a
mock flourish as she modestly stood back to let him enter
first.</p>

<p>The summer evening was warm, and the odours of
viands potent in the coffee-room. The tables were
crowded; there was an immense buzz of voices, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
clatter of knives and forks, and a running to and fro of
aproned drawers, and sturdy bare-armed wenches.</p>

<p>Pamela stood at the door, and looked in discontentedly.
She was as little squeamish as any healthy young
woman of her class; she left “vapours” and “qualms”
to her betters. But the long day had tired her, and
there was my Lord, with his wig askew, and a couple of
bottles before him, and an air of having already done
some justice to them. It was all very well to have
chosen the propriety of the public room, but it might
have its drawbacks. A poor girl never knew what
spiteful eyes might be watching. It would do her no
good if some loose tongue were to start a bit of scandal
about her: “Miss Pamela Pounce behaving shameful
with my Lord Kilcroney, as brazen as you like, before
everybody.” It would always be, of course, the poor
girl who behaved shameful, never the half-tipsy nobleman.
Such is the way of the world.</p>

<p>“And as like as not,” went on Pamela to herself—she
had a vivid and swift imagination—“the next thing will
be: ‘They left Weymouth together. ’Twas a regular
elopement.’ No, thank you, Pamela, my girl. It ain’t
good enough for us to sit next to my Lord in his cups, and
eat beef-steak pudding—a dish I never was partial to—on
a hot night—and lose my character to boot.”</p>

<p>She whisked round and out through the luggage-piled
hall into the yard, where, by the gate which gave upon
the river meadow, she had marked a bench erected round
an old tree stump.</p>

<p>“I’ll sit here,” resolved Miss Pounce, suiting the
action to the thought. “And, by and by, when those
creatures have done gorging within, I’ll have a little
supper by my own. Lord, how vastly more pleasant it
is out here!”</p>

<p>She drew a long breath, inhaling the air, sweet with
the near fragrance of honeysuckle, and distant scents of
ripe corn. She clasped her hands on her knees—those
busy, clever hands which so seldom rested—and gazed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
dreamily out upon the scene. It made a pleasant picture;
the red-tiled roof of the stables was beginning
to glow in the warm evening light; the irregular outline
of the old inn, already in shadow, was cut darkly
against the limpid blue of the sky; white and grey
pigeons flitted lazily hither and thither. From within
the open stable doors came peaceful sounds of munching
jaws, rattling chains, and now and again a stamping
hoof. A fat tortoiseshell cat sat licking herself on a
window sill. There was not a human creature in sight
for the moment, and Miss Pounce felt quite poetic.</p>

<p>But she was not destined to be indulged long in her
rare mood for solitude. There came a clatter of hoofs,
a hum of wheels along the dusty road. A high curricle
swung into the yard, at the raking trot of a tall chestnut
driven by a reckless hand. It was drawn up with a
splash of protesting hoofs; and Pamela, suddenly pricked
to interest, beheld, springing unaided from the high
perch, the young lady whose erratic conduct had earned
for her the sobriquet of “the Mad Brat,” Lady Selina,
who had scandalised society, outraged her Royal patrons,
alienated her friends, and positively stupefied her family
a bare three months ago by eloping, from the very back
of the Princess’s chair at the Opera, with a penniless
insignificant officer of Marines of the name of Simpson.
Lady Selina Simpson’s further career, though necessarily
passed in comparative obscurity, had done little to lessen
the aptness of the sobriquet. Much the contrary, indeed,
and—Lieutenant Simpson being stationed at Weymouth—Lady
Selina had had an unexpected opportunity for a
display of eccentricity, which made both her elder sisters
agree for once that something must be done to put a
stop to Selina’s goings on—“under the very nose of the
Royals, my dear; she does it on purpose to discredit
us,”—even if something entailed the purchase for
Lieutenant Simpson of some post pleasantly remote in
the Indies.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the Mad Brat, as naughty and modish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
as you please (Miss Pamela’s professional eye was quick
to notice); wrapped to the ears in a military looking
cloak of elegant blue, and hatted with as smart a little
beaver, also of military cock, as she, Pamela, had ever
seen—and that was saying a great deal.</p>

<p>My young Lady Selina’s curls were scarcely powdered,
and shone very golden under the evening light, set in
flying bunches each side of her narrow, pretty, pale, impertinent
face. There was something in the expression
of her countenance, attractive for all its wilfulness, that
made Pamela’s quick wits jump to the horrid conclusion—before
even she had clapped eyes on the driver of the
curricle.</p>

<p>“Lord! if ever I see the look of one bent on a desperate
course, I see it this minute!” thought the milliner,
turning the glance on Lady Selina’s companion.</p>

<p>And there it was for you. That black-avised gentleman,
with the bushy black eyebrows, and the small,
restless black eyes beneath, with the blue chin and full,
insolent mouth—that was never young Simpson! “Some
elderly rip, out of the poor lad’s regiment!” diagnosed
Pamela rapidly, seeing the gold-lace glint. “And that
is why my young Madam is so monstrous military herself.
If ever I see an elopement——!”</p>

<p>And indeed, the two had a flushed and conscious air;
defiant, suspicious.</p>

<p>“However you may try to brazen it out, your heart’s
as heavy as lead, you poor silly thing,” was the next
conclusion of the watcher. “As for you, you wicked
wretch, you are all ardours and whispers, all swollen
with triumph, yet you aren’t a bit sure of her. There,
now, I knew it—she won’t let you lead her in, with your
arm about her waist; not even let you take her hand.
She’s no notion to have you blazon her your conquest,
for all the Inn company to see. Mercy on us, there’s a
toss of the head! Aye, and here’s a look for you, my
fine gentleman! No—I wouldn’t make too sure of her
yet, if I were you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>The sound of hoofs and wheels, and of the clanging
bell had brought landlord and landlady to the doorway.
Pamela emerged slowly from her leafy retreat. She
had a mind to keep the Mad Brat under observation as
long as she could.</p>

<p>’Twas a mere child! Pamela knew that she could
scarce have reached her twentieth year; and Pamela
had once herself been mighty near flinging away everything
a woman should hold dear, for a man’s smile. She
had been saved, on the very edge of the precipice, by a
sort of miracle. And she often had shuddered, contemplating
the horrible depth of the chasm into which
she had all but fallen. Did she not now read on the
young wife’s face something of the frantic recklessness
that had once moved her?</p>

<p>Besides which she had a pride in her sex which made it
personally grievous to her when a woman went wrong.
And lastly, she flattered herself she was a judge of character,
and yonder military buck was a bad, dissipated,
selfish wretch, with no use for a woman but to break
her heart.</p>

<p>As she entered the hall, discreetly, in the wake of the
new-comers, she found Lady Selina in high wrangle
with her swain.</p>

<p>“And I say, I will have a post-chaise, Colonel Endacott!
And I protest you’re making a vast mistake!
Pray, Mr. Landlord, a bowl of broth and a glass of wine
in a private parlour—and a post-chaise, with a decent
pair of horses, in an hour. The gentleman will go to the
coffee-room. Yes, sir—you will go to the coffee-room.
Do I hear you curse, sir? La! here is a charming thing,
indeed!”</p>

<p>Suddenly her eye became fixed, she uttered an exclamation
in a high tone of surprise and excitement.</p>

<p>“Sir Jasper Standish—as I am a living woman!”</p>

<p>Pamela then perceived, standing in the doorway of the
coffee-room chewing a gold toothpick, no less a personage
than that dashing widower. He was surveying his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
whilom betrothed and her illicit cavalier with a bantering,
swaggering, insolent air in which there was more than
a glint of jealous anger.</p>

<p>As Lady Selina hailed him, he tripped forward. “Good
heavens,” reflected the milliner, “I’d slap any man’s
face, gentleman or no, who dared to look at me like that!”</p>

<p>Colonel Endacott, biting his full under lip, and blackly
scowling, seemed very much of this opinion; but the
Mad Brat extended both hands:</p>

<p>“Sir Jasper!—well met! ’Tis a vast of pleasure for
me to greet an old friend. Why, here am I, on my road
to London—pray, Colonel Endacott, do you know Sir
Jasper Standish? Gentlemen, let me introduce you:
Colonel Endacott—Sir Jasper Standish. Hearing that
I was about to post to London, Colonel Endacott kindly
offered me a seat in his curricle. My husband’s Colonel,
Sir Jasper. The wife of a poor Lieutenant, it was no
offer to decline! Colonel Endacott, who is really all
condescension and good nature, Sir Jasper, had further
been so obliging as to offer me his escort for the whole
way. But the mischief is in it, we must part at the
first stage! Colonel Endacott will have it he must lie
at Blandford, and I am equally determined to push on!”</p>

<p>Colonel Endacott ground his high-booted foot on the
flags of the hall, as though he would pulverise the volatile
lady who was so obviously making a mock of him.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear Lady Selina,” cried Sir Jasper, in a
rich voice of victory, “let me then be your escort!
Fie, fie, you cannot think of travelling alone with a mere
post-boy for protection, and the roads so unsafe. I
could not think of allowing it! So old a friend as I am
may surely be permitted the privilege, the honour, the
duty——”</p>

<p>“Pray, sir,” interrupted Colonel Endacott, his tones
were husky with rage, “you misunderstand, I think.
Lady Selina Simpson is under my protection. It was
entirely for her sake——” Here he cast a glance of
mingled ardour and fury upon the Mad Brat who tossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
her head till her ringlets danced and hunched a shoulder
on him in its military cloak, with a taunting glance.
“’Twas but for her sake,” the harsh accents grew raucous,
“that I suggested the night’s rest here. Lady
Selina knows that she had but to speak the word, and
I am ready——”</p>

<p>“Ah, not at all!—<i>pas du tout!</i>” cried Lady Selina,
who had a French mother and certain inherited French
ways that added not a little to her provoking charm.
“<i>M. le Colonel</i> has made such big eyes at me I am positively
frightened of him! And my dear mamma—do you
know Sir Jasper, my dear widowed mother is at Wimbledon,
and I have half a mind to go see her there—Mamma
would be desolated if I were to travel under the escort of
a gentleman who is not my husband. Since my Frederick
is so tied up in his military duty—yes, you cruel man,
you saw to that! But with Sir Jasper, Mamma knows
Sir Jasper so well! Pray Mistress Landlady, bring me to
a chamber where I can wash the dust off my face. ’Tis
vile travelling in an open curricle. And you, Mr. Landlord,
what of that parlour and that broth? How would
it be, Sir Jasper, if you were to join me over this slight
refection? We could discuss the journey.”</p>

<p>Sir Jasper drew a long breath through dilated nostrils,
and bowed, the corners of his lips tilting upwards in a
smile of immense complacency. The landlady, who had
been staring at the young Madam with amazement and
disapproval, majestically led the way up the narrow
stairs, expressing by a tremulous shake of her lace-capped
head, and an occasional loud sniff, that such
manners and customs were not to be encouraged on her
premises.</p>

<p>Pamela Pounce saw the look which Colonel Endacott
cast at the fatuously smirking Sir Jasper.</p>

<p>“There will be swords drawn over this, before my
Lady Selina has had time to dry that dusty face of hers!”
she thought. “And dear, to goodness, I have it in my
heart to hope it may be Sir Jasper, for if not, it is out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
the frying-pan into the fire with her, imp of mischief
as she is!”</p>

<p>Out of the frying-pan into the fire it was. Colonel
Endacott and Sir Jasper strolled, to all appearance, very
amicably together through the meadow gate, in the
direction of a certain hazel copse by the river-side. In a
very short time, Sir Jasper reappeared, alone; and,
strolling back into the stable-yard of the Crown, directed,
with the most genteel coolness, that a couple of ostlers
should take a wheelbarrow and a chair, or maybe a
hurdle, and carry in his friend, who had had an accident
to his leg, and would be found, incapacitated, just beside
yonder little copse. It was not a matter of the least
consequence, he assured them—a mere sprain, a scratch,
or something of the sort.</p>

<p>The ostlers grinned. He cast a gold piece among them
and passed on, treading jauntily, in quest of the parlour.</p>

<p>Miss Pounce, eating bread-and-butter and cold meats,
to a modest bowl of milk in the window seat of the now
nearly deserted coffee-room, saw the gallant gentleman’s
return, and understood.</p>

<p>“’Tis the devil and all,” she thought, “that my Lord
Kilcroney is so free with his bottle; he might be of use
here. If my Lady Selina thinks she can fling off Sir
Jasper as easy as she has her Colonel, she is mighty
mistaken. Such a chance doesn’t come a woman’s way
twice! Silly child, and him with an old score to pay off—and
their starting off by night and all—why, what ails
the creature, to be up to such cantrips?” thought Pamela.</p>

<p>She bit into her bread-and-butter, and then flung the
slice away from her. “Well, drunk or sober, my Lord
will be better than nobody.”</p>

<p>Upon this decision Pamela shook the crumbs from her
skirt, set a hand on each hip, and holding her white chin
very high in the air, made a bee line for the snuggery
whence loud sounds of mirth proclaimed the presence
of convivial company.</p>

<p>Here she found my Lord, with a long clay pipe in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
hand, and cool tankard in the other, hilariously setting
the tune to a roaring chorus consisting of a lumpish young
squire, a land surveyor and the local doctor. My Lord
was more than exhilarated, as Pamela saw at the first
glance. He went on melodiously chanting and beating
time, while the others, staring at the handsome girl, fell
dumb, and young Squire Pitt, all one purple blush, began
bashfully to draw himself out of his chair.</p>

<p>“My Lord—my Lord Kilcroney!” began Pamela
with an unwonted sense of discomfiture, “I crave a word
apart with your Lordship.”</p>

<p>But before she could make her voice heard, she was
unceremoniously thrust aside by Mr. Landlord himself.</p>

<p>“And, craving <i>your</i> pardon,” he chided, “this is no
place for young gals. Doctor Dawson, sir, you’re
wanted.”</p>

<p>A dark man in a scratch wig, with a long bony face,
and a restless protruding jaw, jumped up from his corner,
and came forward.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” quoth he, feeling about his
pockets with big knuckly hands that made Pamela
shudder.</p>

<p>“Why, will you step outside, sir. Gentleman hurt
through the leg.”</p>

<p>“Odds my bones, I’ve left it at home. You’ll have to
send little Jimmy for my instrument-case. What’s
happened, I say?”</p>

<p>The landlord wagged his head slyly, pinching his lips
together, and made a thrusting gesture with his right
forefinger; then he tapped the same finger on the side
of his rubicund nose.</p>

<p>The doctor gave a short laugh; and, with a not altogether
steady step, suffered himself to be led down the
passage.</p>

<p>Lord Kilcroney imitated the double gesture with his
pipe-stem and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Now, glory be to God,” said he, “if I had known
there was such a diversion on hand——” Here he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
seemed suddenly to become aware that Miss Pounce’s
presence in the snuggery portended something distinctly
unusual. As he stared at her with a flicker of returning
acuteness in his amiable eye, she seized the opportunity.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, my Lord, give me a moment apart.”</p>

<p>He lurched towards her; and she seized him by the lapel
of his coat; again he looked at her; caught perhaps something
of the urgency of her spirit, and said, in altered
tones:</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, me girl, I’ll just drain the tankard to
steady my head; and I am with you.”</p>

<p>She got him as far as the window seat in the coffee-room;
and then, casting a glance without, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“See for yourself. Turn your eye yonder, and see for
yourself.”</p>

<p>Lord Kilcroney flung a bewildered gaze in the direction
of her pointed finger; opened his mouth, closed it again
and wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>“Jasper! Jasper Standish and a lady, as I live!
What the dev——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know the lady, my Lord? See now, see
now, with the lamplight on her face. She is getting into
the chaise. Don’t you recognise Lady Selina Simpson?”</p>

<p>“Se—Selina Simpson!” echoed he with a fine tipsy
sibilance. He let himself fall on the window seat, and
gripped his head in both hands. “S—Selina?”</p>

<p>“The Mad Brat, my Lord! Good God, we are too
late, the chaise is driving away! This will be fine hearing
for my Lady Verney, and for your lady’s own dear
friend, Lady Nan!”</p>

<p>Lord Kilcroney dropped his hands and sat, with protruding
eyeballs, staring at Pamela. Then his waistcoat
was shaken with a rumbling laugh; and he made an uncertain
poke with his forefinger.</p>

<p>“And, is it poor Simpson, then, that’s in the claws of
that old red raven of a doctor this minute? And my
Lady off with Jasper? D’ye know, it’s a monstrous joke!
Oh, Gad—Jasper was her first love!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>Pamela flung a single searching look upon him. He
was muttering to himself, and laughing, winking, and
shaking his head, the picture of affable inebriety.</p>

<p>“My Lord, my Lord, you must pull yourself together!
Lady Selina is not twenty yet. And him such a bold,
bad man, as indeed you know, my Lord. ’Tis ruin, ’tis
disgrace, for her, and that poor innocent lad, her husband!”</p>

<p>“By the powers!” Kilcroney staggered to his feet.
“Jasper’s a scoundrel! I’ll not have it! What, Nan
Day’s little sister, mere child—monstrous! Get me a
wet napkin, girl.”</p>

<p>He plucked his wig from his head as he spoke, and
looked, Pamela thought, singularly boyish with his close-cropped
red poll exposed to view. Even as she hurried
out to summon the drawer, a brilliant idea struck her.</p>

<p>Colonel Endacott’s curricle, and a fresh horse! With
anything of a roadster, so light a vehicle should easily
overtake the post-chaise. ’Twas a plan of retributive
justice which pleased Miss Pounce hugely.</p>

<p>What woman wills, God wills, is an adage invented by
some sycophantic admirer of the fair sex. Nevertheless,
there is no doubt that the world is apt to give way before
anyone with determined purpose, and, if this anyone
happens to be young, handsome, and a woman, the odds
are overwhelmingly in her favour. Pamela ordered,
cajoled, reasoned, implored, bustled, taunted and threatened.
She made lavish, yet judicious, use of her Weymouth
earnings; and before the half-hour was out, found
herself, high-perched by the side of my Lord (a strange
figure, with the wet napkin still tied round his head),
driving—as the group of ostlers who watched him depart
unanimously declared with much admiration—like hell.</p>

<p>It was one of those summer nights when scarce a leaf
stirs; there was not a cloud upon the sky which stretched
a wonderful amethyst blue, deepening to sapphire at the
zenith, and paling into translucent primrose to the west,
where the last traces of the afterglow still lingered.
There would be a fine moon presently, had been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
landlord’s parting words, as he respectfully deposited his
Lordship’s wig, hat and pistol case in the curricle. The
streets of the sleepy little town were clatteringly left
behind; the steep hill surmounted; and then the Salisbury
road lay before them, straight and white across the grey
mystery of the downs.</p>

<p>Pamela thought it was the strangest night vision she
had ever beheld. The earth seemed as featureless as
the sky; the winds, which had slept in the valley, were
lively enough here, as if the earth were their playground.
There was a wonderful harvest smell, warm and wholesome,
of ripening apples and full corn-fields, in the air—a
great, mellow, sweet aroma from the fertile fields and
farms that lay below the down lands.</p>

<p>Pamela was not romantic, yet she could not but feel
that it was “as good as play-acting” to be hurled through
the summer night across this vast peaceful loneliness,
by this same mad, kind, fantastic Irish lord whose odd
adventures were always the talk of the town.</p>

<p>“A stern chase is a long chase,” observed the nobleman,
dexterously tipping the flanks of the big bay.</p>

<p>The horse bounded, and the curricle rocked; and
Pamela choked a scream. Over the crest of the down
a huge red moon began to show her face, swimming in a
curious misty incandescence. She sucked in her breath,
and her heart stirred sentimentally. If only the man of
her choice had been sitting beside her, how vastly she
would have enjoyed herself!</p>

<p>They swung through the shadows of a copse and out into
the open again. My Lord cast his napkin into the road;
he begged Pamela to lend him a hand with his wig. The
black horse had fallen to a foot pace up the steep incline,
and my Lord, with returning sobriety, began apparently
to consider the kind of undertaking into which he had
plunged, and how to carry it through.</p>

<p>“We’ll not,” said he, gliding into speed again with the
care of the practised whip, “overhaul them much before
Salisbury.” Then the moonlight caught his face, showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
his quizzical smile, and the rueful questioning of his eyes,
as he went on: “And what the dickens am I to say, when
we do? Split me, Miss Pounce, you’ve rushed me into
a pretty kettle of fish! Bejabers, what in the world is it
to me all said and done, that Jasper should be off with
that little lady?”</p>

<p>“Oh fie, my Lord——” began Pamela warmly. But he
interrupted her:</p>

<p>“Well, well, never fear, ’tis as good an excuse as
another for a bit of fun. Faith, didn’t my Lady tell me
the other day, it was the regular old gentleman I was
growing into!”</p>

<p>He caught her absently by the waist, as he spoke,
laughing as the vehicle swerved; and Pamela found
herself again wishing for the company of the dark-browed
slim young gentleman to whom she had given her heart,
and who—Mr. Jocelyn had such sensibility—would have
understood the really grave nature of this seemingly
mad quest.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was after two hours’ steady chase, even as the road
dipped from the downs into the valley, back again into
the corn-fields—these had a marvellous silver and amber
glow in the moonlight—that they saw, half a furlong
away, the black bulk of a moving vehicle, and heard the
double clatter of leisurely trotting horses.</p>

<p>“’Tis but another farm waggon,” quoth my Lord.</p>

<p>“Nay,” cried Pamela, “for I see the bobbing of the
post-boy, plain as plain.”</p>

<p>“Do you, indeed, my dear?” cried my Lord in exhilarated
accents, handling the reins with a zest that sent
the horse forward with a great impetus. “You haven’t
dathered your sight with the Crown’s noted treble ale.
Well, if this isn’t the fun of the world! I’ve stopped a
coach before, my dear—that in your ear—but split me,
never from a curricle, with a monstrous fine girl beside
me!”</p>

<p>“I’m a farmer’s daughter,” she said resolutely, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
can manage a horse with anyone. So I can take the
reins, my Lord, when you want your hands free.”</p>

<p>“’Pon me sowl!” ejaculated Kilcroney admiringly.
But he proceeded no further, for the black horse, gathering
speed, and excited by the clatter of rival hoofs, made a
dash forward, and my Lord, with voice and cracking lash,
encouraged the canter to a gallop.</p>

<p>The post-boy started from his jogging trance, looked over
his shoulder and hastily pulled to one side. The curricle
went by at a flash; my Lord never slackened speed till they
had reached the bottom of the hill and a bit beyond.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Kilcroney, as he manœuvred the curricle
right across the road, “now for the fun of the fair!
Just put your lovely hand under the seat and see if you
can lay a hould of me pistols.”</p>

<p>(My Lord’s brogue became agreeably marked in moments
of emotion.)</p>

<p>The black horse was dancing from hoof to hoof; the
curricle swayed rhythmically to his capers, and Pamela
felt, when her companion plucked the pistols from the
case she held open, as if every fibre of her being were
dancing in unison; exhilaration, a sense of splendid
adventure, a spice of fear, and a delightful recklessness
had hold of her. She almost understood now how the
“Mad Brat” could fling everything to the winds for the
mere taste of such a moment. Lord Kilcroney thrust
the reins into her hands, leaped lightly from his perch;
and he, too, seemed to dance in the moonlight as he
advanced towards the chaise.</p>

<p>The post-boy had prudently pulled up at sight of the
obstacle in the road; now, as the pistol barrels glinted in
the moonlight, he raised a dismal shout, and dived sideways
off the fat grey haunches of his mount. The landlord
of the Crown had provided a stalwart plodding pair
for Lady Selina’s post-chaise; and these were content
enough to draw breath, craning their necks, snorting
comfortably down their nostrils, and shuddering in turn
till the harness rattled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>“How now!” cried an angry voice from the chaise,
and Sir Jasper’s head emerged into the moonlight.
“What’s the matter? rascal, scamp! Hallo, stap me!”
This in quite another tone. “Why, the devil—’tis a
highwayman, a footpad!”</p>

<p>Kilcroney, who had planted himself sideways, with
face concealed by his extended arm, chaunted in the most
musical tones he could muster:</p>

<p>“Stand and deliver!” Then, breaking into laughter,
he disclosed his countenance, with a fine flourish
of his mantons; “Stand and deliver,” he repeated.
“Jasper, stand and deliver your stolen goods!”</p>

<p>There was a faint cry within the chaise, altogether lost
in the round volley of oaths from Sir Jasper. He consigned
Kilcroney’s soul to perdition, and his body to
corruption, with explicitness and repetition, and commanded
the post-boy to remount and carry on, if he did
not wish to be flayed alive. But the sagacious youth
was apparently swallowed in the darkness.</p>

<p>Presently Kilcroney’s shouts of laughter were echoed
in silver titters both from the chaise and the curricle.
These sounds goaded the baronet to madness. “Poor
Jasper!” (Kilcroney afterwards related) “He was
foaming like a tankard of porter, and was almost as black
in the face, by Jingo, when he lepped from the chaise and
at me. Troth, he had his sword out, and sure the next
moment he would have let the moonlight through me,
hadn’t my little lady in the chaise caught him by the
skirts of his coat! It was the grand slap he came on the
flint of the road—aye, and the grand escape I had of it
intirely! ‘Up with you, me boy, and we’ll have it out
like gentlemen,’ cries I, and by the time he got up again
I was ready for him, as pretty as Angelo, with the barkers
back in my pocket and my little bodkin taking the air
in my hand.”</p>

<p>It was not the first time that my Lord Kilcroney and
Sir Jasper had crossed blades. Indeed, Kilcroney’s
mercurial temperament, and Sir Jasper’s inflammably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
jealous one, had come into collision more than once. In
the last encounter the Irishman had had the worst of it;
but to-night, whatever disability the day’s potations
might have caused him was more than counter-balanced
by the blind rage which possessed the baronet as he fell
to his guard.</p>

<p>Perhaps Sir Jasper had been already in none too good a
temper when the novel highwayman had arrested him in
the full course of elopement, certainly the countenance
with which his Helen watched the encounter from the
chaise window displayed more entertainment than
anxiety. In fact, when Sir Jasper, receiving a neat
thrust through his sword arm, fell back with a curse and
a groan, it was Pamela who cried out in alarm, while
Lady Selina shrilly laughed and clapped her hands.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An odd little procession towards midnight roused the
slumbers of the Mitre Inn at Salisbury, with peremptory
summons. Two ladies in a post-chaise, escorted by two
gentlemen in a curricle. The ladies seemed to be in high
dudgeon with each other. The gentlemen very friendly.
Indeed, the younger and better-looking of the two (though
both were personable men) was distinctly assiduous in
his attention to the other, who had (as the landlord was
duly informed) met with a nasty accident through the
overturning of the curricle at a sharp corner, which robbed
him of the use of his right arm.</p>

<p>The post-boy had a curious tale to tell over a restoring
mug of ale. But so scared and bewildered did he appear;
so monstrous a jumble did he make of highwaymen and
duels, that the landlord, who was a sensible man, diagnosed
pure coward’s flim-flams, and promptly dismissed
him to his straw.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Pamela slept late. She had been allotted the dressing-room
of the superior bed-chamber which she had herself
claimed for Lady Selina. Her last thought, as she
snuggled down in the feather bed, had been: “I’ve got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
her safe, the little fool!” and the first that bore into her
consciousness in the morning was the same comforting
reflection: “I’ve got her safe.”</p>

<p>Angry words had passed between the two women in
the chaise last night. Though Pamela had been unable
to make head or tail of the arguments produced by the
“Mad Brat” to justify her conduct, every word had
revealed a childish inconsequence.</p>

<p>“One would say,” thought the milliner, as she lay,
reflecting on her impressions, “that the silly chit had
laid some wager, or was pretending to be wicked for the
mere show off of the thing. For, if ever I saw a gentleman
set down, it was Sir Jasper last night! In my opinion
he was mortal glad to be out of it at the price. Never
saw him so loving with my Lord! And, as for her, she
looked at him like a wild cat, as she passed him by, on the
way to her room.”</p>

<p>Pamela sat on the edge of her bed, yawned, and gazed
at the door which separated her from Lady Selina’s
apartment, congratulating herself that, so old-fashioned
was the hostelry, there was no other issue. But, as she
looked, the smile faded from her face. The door was not
quite closed! She remembered very well how my Lady
Selina had banged and bolted it last night, intimating
thereby, better than by any speech, what she thought
of the intrusive proximity of the milliner.</p>

<p>“It’s not possible——!” On the spur of suspicion,
Pamela was out of bed and into the next room at a spring.
Sunshine was pouring in between the open shutters;
the great four-post bed was empty. There was no trace
of the fair delinquent, save a long gauntletted glove on
the floor.</p>

<p>“Well, of all—of all the minxes!” Miss Pounce
pivoted on herself. “Pamela, my girl, you’re fooled!
And you such a light sleeper, to think you should have
slept so deep and let the bird fly!”</p>

<p>She ran back to her own room and, after ringing the
bell violently, proceeded like a hurricane to her toilet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
Cold water and yellow soap were good enough for her any
day. The service at the Mitre seemed scarce like to add
to its reputation. Miss Pounce was well advanced,
indeed she had reached the stage of buttoning her trim
figure into the grey riding coat, before the repeated
attacks on the bell-pull produced a panting housemaid.</p>

<p>“Oh, please, Miss,” began this damsel volubly, “was
you ringing? I was kept by the gentlemen in Blue
Parrot, helping the gentleman to bind the other gentleman’s
arm, what hurt himself. And that there post-boy
was not so far out, for if ever I see a sword cut——”</p>

<p>Pamela interrupted with an ejaculation of relief.</p>

<p>“Sir Jasper is still in the inn, then? And my Lord,
too?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Miss——”</p>

<p>“And the lady?”</p>

<p>“The lady’s been gone this hour, Miss. Oh, aye, she
went off with the other gentleman——”</p>

<p>“What——?” shrieked Pamela.</p>

<p>“Oh, aye, Miss! The handsome, dark gentleman
what travelled all the way from London to meet her.
Last night, when he came riding in, missis and all of us
agreed, we never saw a handsomer gentleman. ‘I expect,’
says he, ‘a lady by coach from Weymouth.’”
She stopped to stare: “Be’n’t you well, Miss?”</p>

<p>Pamela had fallen into a chair. A cold and pricking
fear had laid hold of her. There are premonitions of
the heart which out-leap any perception of the wits.</p>

<p>“His name, his name!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Lud, now!” The girl clacked her tongue. “I did
hear her call him——”</p>

<p>“Stay!” cried Pamela. “Was it Bellairs?”</p>

<p>“Lud, Miss,” cried the girl, “however did you know?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Miss Pounce sternly, “I am the lady
he came to meet.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With the same deadly composure she ordered a post-chaise,
and started once again in pursuit. This time she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
would have no man’s help. She would go alone. “What
business is it of yours?” had cried Lady Selina insolently,
last night. And she had answered: “It’s every true
woman’s business to keep another straight if she can.”
But now, here was no altruistic interference; here love
and life were at stake for her. Here was her own business
and nobody else’s, with a vengeance!</p>

<p>Gone this hour! Well, she would overtake them at
Basingstoke, where they must halt of a certainty.</p>

<p>Pamela had had, in a little purse apart, twenty golden
guineas, her own profit in the successful week’s transactions
in modes at Weymouth. She had meant to add
them to the comfortable nest of savings which were to
facilitate her marriage with her charming spendthrift.
Now the shining company in the green silk meshes had
already notably dwindled; and at every five miles or so,
Pamela would draw forth a coin and, thrusting her
pretty head out of the window, would hail the post-boy
and hold it up to his sight.</p>

<p>“Another goldfinch for you, my lad, if you mend your
speed!”</p>

<p>By the time they reached Basingstoke there were four
sovereigns for the youth; and if he was sweating, it was
nothing to which the horses were doing. They dripped
and trembled and steamed, foam-flecked from mane to
tail. Pamela’s green purse was considerably lighter;
but it had been worth it. The fat dappled greys which
had trotted off with my Lady Selina and Mr. Bellairs that
morning were even now being led out of the shafts. A
comfortable trot they had come at, to judge by their
untroubled appearance.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss,” said the formidable-looking landlady who
ruled at the Angel, Basingstoke, and who, no doubt,
found a distinct growth of beard and a bass voice as useful
to her if not more than the support of any man. “A
lady and a gentleman are partaking of refreshment in
the parlour. And what might you be wanting with
them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>Her eye, small and fierce as a wild boar’s, appraised
the new guest up and down.</p>

<p>Pamela saw that travelling alone she was suspect;
she had an inspiration.</p>

<p>“I am Lady Selina’s own woman,” she said pertly.
“Her Ladyship expects me. Kindly direct me.”</p>

<p>She had seen too many lady’s maids not to be able to
play the part: she was now the fashionable Abigail to
the life—plausible, supple, sure of herself; her gaze was
challenging; her air deferential, yet on the verge of
insolence.</p>

<p>The bearded landlady shrugged her shoulders, and told
the drawer to bring Miss into Britannia.</p>

<p>“You needn’t knock, young man, I will announce
myself,” said Pamela. She tapped discreetly with her
nails on the panel just beneath the figure with the trident;
then, without waiting for a reply, opened the door.</p>

<p>In one swift glance she took in the scene: the Mad
Brat did not seem to be getting on any better with Mr.
Bellairs than she had with either her Colonel or her
Baronet. She was seated, her elbows on the table, her
chin in her hand. With frowning brows, a fixed and
angry stare, flushed cheeks and pouting lips, she was the
image of “Beauty in a rage.” Mr. Bellairs was pacing
the room with his hands behind his back; and he, too,
the very incarnation of bad temper.</p>

<p>The milliner did not give herself time to reflect whether
the obvious tension betokened good or evil for her. She
had to act.</p>

<p>“If you please, my Lady,” she said, advancing as if
she had been indeed what she represented herself, “you
have forgotten your glove.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” cried Mr. Bellairs. “Pamela!”</p>

<p>He wheeled in his walk to turn upon the newcomer
a countenance marked with the oddest mixture of discomfiture,
amusement and wrath.</p>

<p>Lady Selina merely cast a glance from the glove which
Pamela laid before her to the girl’s face, and lifted her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
eyebrows. She had passed from anger to insolence.
Pamela itched to box her ears.</p>

<p>“I assure you, my dear,” protested Mr. Bellairs in an
ill-assured voice, “that <i>I</i> have forgotten nothing.”</p>

<p>Pamela understood well enough the intention of the
speech; she smiled scornfully. And when Lady Selina,
just rolling her eyes in his direction, dropped the words:
“Except your manners, sir,” she felt certain the rebuke
had been well deserved.</p>

<p>Indeed, now that she came to look at him more closely,
she saw a red patch on the olive of his cheek, and guessed
the offence which had called for such a buffet. Oh! she
knew the ways of men; and, to her philosophy, the
gentleman who, thrust into such a position as Mr. Bellairs,
should have failed to take advantage of it, would have
been little less than a milksop. Nevertheless, there had
been defection. It was her, Pamela, whom he had come
to meet—Pamela his affianced, to whom, because of the
very difference in their stations, he owed more delicacy
of attention than if she had been his equal. And he had
let himself be whisked away by the first wanton who
lifted a beckoning finger! Serve her right if he had kissed,
and serve him right if she had slapped! Oh, she knew
the ways of men! But—the ways of the Mad Brat was
still enigma to her. What was this piece of mischief
about? As if to answer the perplexed thought, Lady
Selina suddenly spoke:</p>

<p>“’Tis positive sickening to think that there is not a
gentleman of the lot who would give a lady his protection
as far as Town, without thrusting his odious attentions
on her!”</p>

<p>“But my dear, good creature——”</p>

<p>“I’m not your dear, good creature, sir!” Lady
Selina sprang to her feet and burst into a sudden passion
of tears. “Was ever anyone,” she cried, “so plagued,
so persecuted, so distracted, so unhappy, so—so
abandoned?”</p>

<p>Pamela again felt an overwhelming conviction that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
here was one merely as naughty and as innocent as a
child.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear!” she exclaimed, and caught her
forcibly into her own strong warm arms. There was
more than a touch of the mother in Pamela; she never
could bear to leave suffering uncomforted. “Why, in
the name of God, did you leave your own husband?”</p>

<p>The Mad Brat screamed as if the last word had been a
blow.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, my Fred!”</p>

<p>Pamela cast a look over the bride’s heaving shoulder
at Mr. Bellairs.</p>

<p>“There, sir!” she said severely, “there’s for you and
your vanity! For you, and the others, who are so ready
to think that any lady who so much as smiles on you is
mad in love with you—and all the while you’re but the
catspaw of her jealousy!”</p>

<p>“Pamela!” cried Jocelyn Bellairs. He had been
standing, very ill at ease, struggling with the variety of
his emotions. He now broke into laughter which had
yet something of wrath in it. “I’ve been a confounded
fool! And I swear you are an angel! Oh, confusion!
I can’t bear to hear a woman cry. But I must say
Joseph himself would have been tempted by that little—devil,
this morning!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” cried the milliner, rocking the weeping
Selina as if it had been a baby, but shooting another
glance at Mr. Bellairs which, after all, held more indulgence
than resentment. “Hush, sir! Leave me with
her Ladyship. Go, refresh yourself with a tankard of
cool ale, after your dusty drive—and send the landlady
hither with the hartshorn.”</p>

<p>If Mr. Bellairs had thought highly of Pamela before,
he now told himself she was the pattern of true women.
He paused but to kiss the firm, capable, white hand she
extended to him, and then hastily closed the door between
himself and those distressing vapours.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear,” coaxed Pamela, “I see how it is.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
You’ve had a quarrel with that elegant young officer of
yours. You’ve had a quarrel, and you went off in a huff
with that dark, bad old Colonel——”</p>

<p>Lady Selina shuddered, and stamped her foot; and
inarticulately declared that if she’d had a dagger to her
hand, she’d have stabbed him.</p>

<p>“Well, Sir Jasper’s done it for you, very neat, in the leg.”</p>

<p>Selina interrupted with another scream.</p>

<p>“Sir Jasper? Why, he was worse! Oh, how glad I
was to see My Lord Kilcroney run him through!”</p>

<p>“I’m sure,” said Pamela, a little dryly, “it is a mercy,
my Lady, I came alone after you and Mr. Bellairs!
Mr. Bellairs is engaged to me, my Lady, and I don’t seem
to fancy a hole in him.”</p>

<p>Lady Selina was much too absorbed in her own grief
to have a thought to spare for any such trifles. She fell
again into her chair, cast her arms upon the table and
buried her face on them, wailing, in an extravagance of
despair, that her Fred would never forgive her, and that
there was nothing left for her but death.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s no harm done,” Pamela briskly consoled.
“I’m ready to vouch for you that you’ve travelled
with me, and slept with me——” she broke off.
Her quick ear had caught the sound of certain well-known
accents in the courtyard without.</p>

<p>“Glory be to God,” my Lord was saying, in his richest
brogue. “Will anyone catch me that young gentleman
by the leg? He’s not safe to be loose. Trip him up, I
tell you, or there’ll be murder done! Come back,
Simpson, you <i>omadhaun</i>!”</p>

<p>Pamela made a spring for the door; she had said that
she would not have a hole made in her Jocelyn: heaven
knew what catastrophe might not ensue were she not
on the spot to prevent mischief with Bellairs, apt as
tinder, and this young Simpson in his fury! She went
like the wind down the passage, and across the bar,
towards that spot in the courtyard whence arose sounds
of struggle and fierce objurgation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>She found a slim young gentleman in uniform locked in
the embrace of Lord Kilcroney. My Lord was laughing
so considerably that it threatened to invalidate his grip.
The young officer’s countenance shocked Pamela, so disfigured
was it by rage and jealousy.</p>

<p>Even as she approached he wrenched himself free, and,
leaping forward, all but knocked her down in his blind
rush. Pamela’s body, however, was as well-balanced
as her mind; she propped herself against the Inn porch
and caught the outraged young husband vigorously by
the arm. It was her words which really arrested him.</p>

<p>“You are looking for Lady Selina, Mr. Simpson, sir;
for your wife? She is waiting for you in the parlour.”</p>

<p>He stared at her, his lips moving, his eyes starting, his
whole begrimed, unshorn, exhausted countenance stamped
with a wildness of despair.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Pamela slipped her firm clasp down to his
shaky, ice-cold hand; her voice was as soothing as her
touch: “Yes, sir, her Ladyship and I we came here
together. Her Ladyship was good enough to accept my
services on the road. I’m travelling back to business
from Weymouth, it fitted in nicely. And Mr. Jocelyn
Bellairs, coming to meet me at Salisbury—he and I being
an engaged couple, if you will forgive my being so personal—that
fitted in very nicely too, for he escorted us.
Your lady’s very young to be travelling alone, sir——”</p>

<p>Pamela knew that there is no better defence for the
guilty than to reproach the innocent.</p>

<p>“There now, me boy,” cried Kilcroney, taking up the
cue, “didn’t I tell you it was the wrong scent you were
after, altogether? Hadn’t ye me word for it that
Colonel Endacott and Jasper had fixed up that little
meeting at Blandford ever since the night of my Lady
Kilcroney’s rout at Weymouth? And sure, when my
Lady Selina walked into the Crown Inn, wasn’t Miss
Pounce behind her? Miss Pounce will swear to that.
And I’ll lay you me oath that she’s speaking truth, since
it’s the one coach-load of it we all were.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>But whether or no these assurances and plausibilities
might have proved convincing to the inflamed brain of
the injured husband, they were doomed to failure by the
action of the Mad Brat herself.</p>

<p>This impetuous young woman suddenly hurled herself
into their midst and upon her husband’s breast,
tears, kisses, passionate confession pouring from her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Fred, Fred, darling! Oh, my own and only love—I
tried to run away from you, and I couldn’t! Fred,
my angel, it was all that cruel thing—that cruel thing
you said. Oh, Fred, you do remember?” She shook
him. “You know you said that you did not think any
other man would be such a f-f-fool—Yes, you did—you
said no other man would be such a f-fool as to run away
with me!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>My Lord Kilcroney, with his Lady and the other
friends interested in the erratic young couple, were all
agreed that the Mad Brat was well matched in her
spouse. For of all the hot-headed, light-witted, frantic
fellows—these were my Lord’s own words—he had ever
had to deal with, Lieutenant Fred Simpson, of the
Marines, was the “jewel of the lot!” The united efforts
of himself, Squire Day, and Lord Verney, were ultimately
successful, however, in preventing the series of duels
which Master Fred at first seemed bent on bringing
about. Even Lord Kilcroney did not escape a challenge;
but on his representing his services on the Salisbury
Road, the affair had to end in a laugh. Mr. Jocelyn
Bellairs, on Pamela’s prompting, made a very frank and
full apology, couched in language so admirably chosen,
that even the young Othello had to be satisfied with it.</p>

<p>“I confess,” he said, “that I was led away, Mr.
Simpson. I confess that I lost my head (and very nearly
my heart). But ask yourself whether, in such company,
an angel from heaven might not have succumbed!”</p>

<p>Providence itself intervened in the matter of Colonel
Endacott, for this gentleman’s wound, whether owing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
original distemper in the blood, or to the ministrations
of Doctor Dawson, became so inflamed that it was held
as more than doubtful whether that gallant officer would
ever walk again. He was invalided out of the regiment,
thereby providing at least one step for Mr. Simpson.</p>

<p>There only remained Sir Jasper—no easy personage
to deal with, as my Lord knew from long experience.
But by the time the baronet’s sword arm had healed an
excellent post abroad had been obtained for Mr. Simpson;
and to the infinite relief of all her relations, the Mad Brat
and her spouse carried their bickerings and reconciliations
to another clime.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="ph1"><span class="smcap">In which my Lady Kilcroney has the Last<br>
Word</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> best-tempered of women are apt to be a trifle peevish
after a wedding, especially if they are responsible for the
event, and have had most of the trouble of the bridal
preparations.</p>

<p>My Lady Kilcroney had had two reasons for patronising
the marriage between Mr. Jocelyn Bellairs and Miss
Pamela Pounce.</p>

<p>In the first place she flattered herself that she had
made it. It pleased her sense of rectitude to know that
it was an heroic decision. Jocelyn, the rascal, had gone
too far, and Pamela was a first-class good girl. ’Twas
but justice.</p>

<p>Then my Lady Kilcroney was a woman of the world,
to her finger-tips. The alliance, which she could not
have prevented if she would, was a strange, foolish,
unequal business. To silence ill-natured gossip and
the malicious tattle of dear, intimate enemies, there was
nothing for it but for her to take a firm stand of championship.
’Twas the only attitude to ensure respect,
from Royalty downwards. To tell the truth, Kitty
was getting a bit sick of Royalty, and would not have
cared had she followed my Lady Flo’s example, but not
upon this crisis. She knew how to take the Queen by
this time, not being a born fool, and, indeed, had emerged
more triumphantly than ever from a situation which
might have lost her her place at Court.</p>

<p>“I thought of you, ma’am,” she had said, turning up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
her eyes, “how you would have wished me to act, you
that sets virtue before everything.”</p>

<p>If the Queen had gathered a lower opinion of Pamela
Pounce’s moral stamina from the interview than was
justified by facts, she had gained a vastly higher one of
my Lady Kilcroney’s. So the incident was closed to
Kitty’s advantage.</p>

<p>And now Pamela was wed, and my Lady Kilcroney
had made quite a droll, pretty feast of it.</p>

<p>Farmer Pounce, in blue cloth and brass buttons, Mrs.
Pounce, in a lovely new bonnet trimmed for the occasion
by her daughter, followed by a rosy progeny, had been
really such honest, simple dears that Kitty quite loved
them; and Pamela (sensible, excellent creature that she
was, who had chosen to be married in a snowy muslin
and a white chip), had looked so sweet and wholesome
and happy, and withal remained so respectfully in her
place, was so pleasantly unassuming, that my Lady very
genuinely considered old Bellairs’s nephew to be more
lucky than he deserved.</p>

<p>She had convened her special circle to witness the
ceremony, which was performed in her own drawing-room
at Hertford Street; not omitting Mistress Lafone,
for Kitty would not put it into the minx’s power to say
that she was afraid of her tongue.</p>

<p>There was a brisk passage between these two ladies,
out of which Kitty, she flattered herself, emerged victorious.</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure,” had said Molly, with her most
tart-sweet air, “how monstrous strange it will be to
be ordering hats from your own niece, my Lady Kilcroney!”</p>

<p>And my Lady had responded: she trusted to Heaven
that Pamela would be more particular than ever, now,
whom she served.</p>

<p>Madame Mirabel had had the good sense to excuse herself
on the ground of age and infirmity; a piece of tact
which, coupled with the handsome present she bestowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
on her esteemed partner, was as clever a stroke of business
as the astute old lady had ever contrived.</p>

<p>Miss Clara Smithson and Miss Polly Popple, on the
other hand, who were, as the whole of the Bond Street
establishment knew, that devoted to their dear, darling
Miss Pounce that they were as glad of her happiness in
the depths of their feeling hearts as if it had been their
own, could not, of course, be omitted from the list of
guests; and indeed, it may be said that Lydia’s only
consolation on a day, which was otherwise unmitigatedly
displeasing to her, was the opportunity which the presence
of these females gave her of discharging her bosom
of some of its accumulated gall.</p>

<p>When all her company had departed, my Lady owned
that she was tired, and Lydia was very plainly given to
understand that she must not presume upon a relationship,
which was, to say the least of it, ridiculous.</p>

<p>Lydia had made herself far finer than the bride, and
Kitty thought it prodigious bad taste in her to be so
ruffled and flounced and panniered.</p>

<p>“And the shade of lavender you’ve chosen, Lydia,
positive sets my teeth on edge, and I should have thought
you’d have known better than to rouge yourself up, till
anyone would take my own woman for an actress, and
a low one at that.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’m sure, your Ladyship,” retorted
Lydia with spirit, “not having any acquaintance with
such females, save your Ladyship’s own dear friend, my
Lady Mandeville (who would have looked better for a bit
of colour to-day), it wouldn’t become me to set myself
up against your Ladyship’s opinion in the matter; but
considering the practice I’ve had on your Ladyship it’s
to be hoped I’d know how to put on the rouge, if I don’t
show it off as well as your Ladyship, not being so full in
the face. And I’m sorry your Ladyship ain’t satisfied
with the hue of my gown, it being one of her own presents
to me, Christmas five years that was. And indeed,”
went on Lydia, “I never could abide it myself, but since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
it was when your Ladyship went sudden out of mourning
for old Mr. Bellairs, and she didn’t know what to do with
the eight yards of taffety, I couldn’t be so disobliging as
not to make the best of them. And indeed, considering
the occasion to-day I thought they fitted in uncommon
apt.”</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure!” cried Kitty, sinking into a chair.
“What a tongue you have! ’Tis to be hoped it isn’t a
family failing or else my poor dear Bellairs’s nephew, the
last of his name, will have a sad time of it.”</p>

<p>“Dear, to be sure!” echoed Lydia, with frightful
acrimony, “I could find it in my heart to pity that pore
young gentleman myself. No one can ever say I wanted
that there owdacious marriage.” (Which was certainly
true. Lydia would infinitely have preferred to see her
niece bloom unplucked on her maiden stem.) “Of all
the unpleasant situations, I says, him to have a wife a
milliner as is born to another class, and spend his days
torn, so to speak, between the high and the low. He’ll
never make a fine lady of Pamela, what’s a work-woman
in the bone, and he can’t,” pursued Lydia, moved
by her own eloquence almost to tears, “strip his own
gentility off of himself like a coat and sit as it were in his
shirt-sleeves, common, for the rest of his life.”</p>

<p>Seeing angry retort leaping in her mistress’s eye,
Lydia proceeded in a great hurry, to get out the next
most disagreeable remark she could think of: “And as
to him being the last of his name, your Ladyship can’t go
counting on that. Mrs. Jocelyn Bellairs,” Lydia tittered,
“will have a long family like her mother before her, and
before we know where we are we’ll have little Bellairses
a-running about all over the place like spiders——”</p>

<p>She broke off. Intimately acquainted with her mistress
as she was, there were sides to her character which
Miss Lydia Pounce had as yet failed to grasp. She had
thought to pay out my Lady for her odious unkindness,
but her shaft had singularly missed the mark. All the
ill-humour vanished from Kitty Kilcroney’s charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
countenance. She clasped her hands with a genuine cry
of delight.</p>

<p>“Why, Lydia, I’ll be godmother to the first girl, I will
indeed! It ought to be a charming creature, they so
handsome and so happy! I’ll be godmother, and ’twill
be a vast of pleasure to me, child, to think there’ll be
another Kitty Bellairs!”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
